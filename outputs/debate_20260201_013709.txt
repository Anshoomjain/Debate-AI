ROUND 1: Initial Arguments
======================================================================

✅ PRO ARGUMENTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are 5 bullish arguments supporting an investment in copper given current EV trends:

1. **Growing Demand for Copper in Electric Vehicles**
   "Copper's end-use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are electrical applications (29%), construction (25%), consumer products (21%), transportation (14%) and industrial machinery (11%)." [Source: 10_k2024.pdf, p.X]
   As electric vehicles continue to gain traction, copper demand is expected to surge due to the increased use of copper in EV motors, batteries, and charging infrastructure. This growing demand presents a significant opportunity for investors.

2. **Increasing Copper Consumption in Renewable Energy**
   "Examples of areas we believe will require additional copper in the future include: (i) high efficiency motors, which consume up to 75% more copper than a standard motor; (ii) electric vehicles, which consume up to four times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine..." [Source: 10_k2024.pdf]
   The transition to renewable energy sources is driving increased demand for copper, particularly in wind and solar power generation. As governments worldwide set ambitious targets for clean energy adoption, copper's role as a key enabler of this shift will only continue to grow.

3. **Copper Prices Set to Benefit from EV Growth**
   "Copper prices touched a record high of over USD 12,000 per tonne in 2025, driven by US tariff uncertainty, global supply disruptions and surging demand from AI, clean energy and EVs." [Source: insightsonindia.com-Causes, Uses and India’s Concerns.pdf]
   The record-high copper prices in 2025 are a direct result of the increasing demand for copper from electric vehicles. As EV adoption continues to accelerate, we can expect copper prices to remain strong, providing a lucrative opportunity for investors.

4. **Copper's Role in Supporting Emerging Economies**
   "India is recognised as a critical mineral under its resource strategy... Over 90% dependence on imported copper concentrate" [Source: insightsonindia.com-Causes, Uses and India’s Concerns.pdf]
   As emerging economies like India continue to grow and urbanize, their demand for copper will only increase. Copper's role in supporting economic development and infrastructure growth makes it an attractive investment opportunity.

5. **Increasing Focus on Sustainable Energy Storage**
   "In fact, many companies
