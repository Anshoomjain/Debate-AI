The following discussions include forward-looking statements that are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially (refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement” in MD&A for further discussion). GENERAL We are a leading international metals company with the objective of being foremost in copper. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, we operate large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable mineral reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. We are one of the world’s largest publicly traded copper producers. Our portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits; and significant operations in North America and South America, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in Arizona and the Cerro Verde operation in Peru. Our results for 2024 reflect solid execution of our operating plans and we are committed to enhancing productivity, managing costs and capital and advancing opportunities for long-term profitable growth and value creation. We believe the actions we have taken in recent years to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain flexible organic growth options will allow us to continue to execute our business plans, and reliably and responsibly generate cash flows to pursue value-enhancing organic growth options and return cash to shareholders. We believe that we have a high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate long-term value, and we remain focused on executing our operating and investment plans. Our underground mining operations at the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia continue to perform well, with copper production increasing in each of the past three years. During 2024, construction of PT Freeport Indonesia’s (PT-FI) new smelter and precious metals refinery (PMR) (collectively, PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities) in Eastern Java, Indonesia were completed and as part of start-up activities, PT-FI commenced gold production from the PMR in December 2024.",

During 2024, construction of PT Freeport Indonesia’s (PT-FI) new smelter and precious metals refinery (PMR) (collectively, PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities) in Eastern Java, Indonesia were completed and as part of start-up activities, PT-FI commenced gold production from the PMR in December 2024. In October 2024, during start-up activities of the new smelter, a fire occurred requiring a temporary suspension of smelting operations to complete repairs. PT-FI expects repairs to be completed by mid-2025 and ramp-up to full capacity to be achieved by year-end 2025. We are progressing initiatives across our North America and South America operations by incorporating new applications, technologies and data analytics to our leaching processes. Incremental copper production from these initiatives totaled 214 million pounds in 2024, compared with a total of 144 million pounds in 2023. We have projects underway to apply recent operational enhancements to our leaching processes on a larger scale and are testing new innovative technology applications that we believe have the potential for significant increases in recoverable metal from leach stockpiles beyond the current run rate. We believe we benefit from significant copper reserves and resources with embedded growth options, an experienced team and exposure to markets with a favorable fundamental outlook. For the year 2024, the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper settlement prices averaged $4.15 per pound (ranging from a low of $3.67 per pound to a high of $4.92 per pound) and closed at $3.95 per pound on December 31, 2024. We believe fundamentals for copper are favorable with growing demand supported by copper’s critical role in the global transition to renewable power, electric vehicles and other carbon-reduction initiatives, continued urbanization in developing countries, data centers and artificial intelligence developments and growing connectivity globally.

COPPER, GOLD AND MOLYBDENUM The following provides a summary of our primary natural resources – copper, gold and molybdenum. Refer to MD&A for further discussion of historical and current market prices of these commodities and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for discussion of factors that can cause price fluctuations. Copper Copper is an internationally traded commodity, and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the LME, Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX) and Shanghai Futures Exchange. Prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand, and can be volatile and cyclical. In general, demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth, particularly in industrial production and construction.",

    "text": "(COMEX) and Shanghai Futures Exchange. Prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand, and can be volatile and cyclical. In general, demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth, particularly in industrial production and construction. According to a 2024 report from Wood Mackenzie, a widely followed independent metals market consultant, copper’s end-use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are electrical applications (29%), construction (25%), consumer products (21%), transportation (14%) and industrial machinery (11%). We believe copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for clean energy and advancement in communications, including the global transition to renewable Table of Contents 3 power, electric vehicles and other carbon-reduction initiatives, continued urbanization in developing countries, data centers and artificial intelligence developments and growing connectivity globally. Examples of areas we believe will require additional copper in the future include: (i) high efficiency motors, which consume up to 75% more copper than a standard motor; (ii) electric vehicles, which consume up to four times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine, and require copper-intensive charging station infrastructure to refuel; and (iii) renewable energy such as wind and solar, which consume four to five times the amount of copper compared to traditional fossil fuel generated power. Gold Gold is used for jewelry, coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications. Gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world. Benchmark prices are generally based on London Bullion Market Association (London) quotations. Molybdenum Molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemical-grade products used in catalysts, lubrication, smoke suppression, corrosion inhibition and pigmentation. Molybdenum-based chemicals are used to produce high-purity molybdenum metal used in electronics such as flat-panel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace. Like copper, demand for molybdenum is positively impacted by new technologies for clean energy. Reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications, but generally based on Platts Metals Daily. PRODUCTS AND SALES Our consolidated revenues for 2024 primarily included sales of copper (74%), gold (17%) and molybdenum (7%). For the three years ended December 31, 2024, the only customers that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues were Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (MMC), PT-FI’s joint venture partner in PT Smelting (PT-FI’s 66%-owned copper smelter and refinery), in 2024 and PT Smelting in 2022. Beginning January 1, 2023, PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting changed to a tolling arrangement so there were no further sales from PT-FI to PT Smelting (refer to Note 2 for further discussion) during 2023 and 2024. Refer to Note 14 for a summary of our consolidated revenues by product and geographic area, and revenues and operating income (loss) by business segment.

Refer to Note 14 for a summary of our consolidated revenues by product and geographic area, and revenues and operating income (loss) by business segment. Copper Products We are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate, cathode and continuous cast copper rod. During 2024, 45% of our mined copper was sold in concentrate, 34% as cathode and 21% as rod. The copper ore from our mines is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) as described below. Copper Concentrate. We produce copper concentrate at six of our mines in which mined ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20% to 30%. In North America, copper concentrate is produced at the Morenci, Bagdad, Sierrita and Chino mines, and a significant portion is shipped to our Miami smelter in Arizona for further processing. Copper concentrate is also produced at the Cerro Verde mine in Peru and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia. Historically, copper concentrate produced in the Grasberg minerals district has been shipped to PT Smelting in Indonesia, Atlantic Copper in Spain and third-party smelters outside of Indonesia. Once PT-FI’s new smelter is fully operational, all of Grasberg’s copper concentrate is expected to be processed within Indonesia. Copper Cathode. We produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in El Paso, Texas, and at nine of our mines. SX/EW cathode is produced from the Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita, Miami, Chino and Tyrone mines in North America, and from the Cerro Verde and El Abra mines in South America. For ore subject to the SX/EW process, the ore is placed on stockpiles and copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulfuric acid solution. The copper content of the solution is increased in two additional SX stages, and then the copper-bearing solution undergoes an EW process to produce cathode that is, on average, 99.99% copper. Our copper cathode is used as the raw material input for copper rod, brass mill products and for other uses. Copper cathode is also produced at Atlantic Copper (our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in Spain) and PT Smelting. Copper concentrate is smelted (i.e., subjected to extreme heat) to produce copper anode, which Table of Contents 4 weighs between 700 and 900 pounds and has an average copper content of 99.5%. We operate a copper smelter in Miami, Arizona that produces copper anode. The anode is further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathode, which weighs between 100 and 350 pounds and has an average copper content of 99.99%. Refer to “Smelting Facilities and Other Mining Properties” for further discussion of PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities, Atlantic Copper, PT Smelting and the Miami smelter.

Refer to “Smelting Facilities and Other Mining Properties” for further discussion of PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities, Atlantic Copper, PT Smelting and the Miami smelter. Continuous Cast Copper Rod. We manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in El Paso, Texas and Miami, Arizona, primarily using copper cathode produced at our North America copper mines. Copper Sales North America. The majority of the copper produced at our North America copper mines and refined in our El Paso, Texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants to produce copper rod, which is then sold to wire and cable manufacturers. The remainder of our North America copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under U.S. dollar-denominated annual contracts. Generally, copper cathode is sold to rod, brass or tube fabricators. Cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing COMEX monthly average settlement price for the month of shipment and include a premium. South America. Production from our South America operations is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under U.S. dollar-denominated, annual and multi-year contracts. During 2024, our South America operations sold 74% of their copper production in concentrate and 26% as cathode. Substantially all of our South America copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted LME monthly average settlement copper prices. Revenues from our South America concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties and treatment charges (i.e., fees paid to smelters that are generally negotiated annually). In addition, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable from the smelting process, revenues from our South America concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals, which are a negotiated term of the contracts and vary by customer. Indonesia. PT-FI has historically sold its production in the form of copper concentrate, which contains significant quantities of gold and silver, primarily under U.S. dollar-denominated, long-term contracts. PT-FI sells a small amount of copper concentrate in the spot market. Following the full ramp-up of PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities, PT-FI’s mining and smelting operations will be fully integrated and copper sales will be in the form of copper cathodes. Beginning in 2023, PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting changed to a tolling arrangement so there were no further sales from PT-FI to PT Smelting during 2023 and 2024. Under this arrangement, PT-FI pays PT Smelting a tolling fee to smelt and refine its concentrate and PT-FI retains title to all products for sale to third parties. PT-FI’s sale of copper cathodes under the tolling arrangement are priced in the month of shipment and are not subject to provisional pricing. During 2024, PT-FI sold 56% of its copper production in concentrate and 44% as cathode.",

Table of Contents 5 Gold Products and Sales We produce gold almost exclusively from our mines in the Grasberg minerals district. The gold we produce is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in anode slimes, which are a product of the smelting and refining process. Gold generally is priced at the average London price for a specified month near the month of shipment. Revenues from gold sold as a component of our copper concentrate are recorded net of treatment charges, royalties, export duties and allowances for unrecoverable metals. Revenues from gold sold in anode slimes are recorded net of royalties and refining charges. As part of start-up activities, PT-FI commenced gold production from its new PMR in December 2024. We began selling gold bars produced by the PMR in February 2025 and the related revenues are recorded net of royalties. Molybdenum Products and Sales According to Wood Mackenzie, we are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenum-based chemicals. In addition to production from the Henderson and Climax molybdenum mines, we produce molybdenum concentrate at certain of our North America copper mines and our Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru. The majority of our molybdenum concentrate is processed in our own conversion facilities.

Compliance with these laws and regulations requires expenditures for the implementation, operation and maintenance of systems and programs, but has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. We continuously monitor and strive to maintain compliance with changes in laws and regulations that impact our business. Mining Rights We conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contracts with, the host government in the countries where we operate. These countries include, among others, the U.S., Peru, Chile and Indonesia. Mining rights include our license to operate and involve our payment of applicable taxes and royalties to the host governments. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with the host countries. For information about mining rights, governmental agreements, licenses to operate, and tax regulations and related matters refer to “Operations” below, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Notes 2, 9, 10 and 11. Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to extensive and complex environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; protection of endangered and threatened species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. In addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations. As a mining company, compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is an integral and costly part of our business. We conduct our operations in a manner that aims to protect public health and the environment. We believe our operations follow applicable laws and regulations in all material respects, and we have internal company policies that in some instances go beyond compliance with such laws and regulations. At December 31, 2024, we had $2.0 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations and $3.7 billion recorded for asset retirement obligations. We incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners’ shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling $0.6 billion in 2024, $0.5 billion in 2023 and $0.4 billion in 2022, and we expect to incur approximately $0.6 billion in 2025. The timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.",

For information about environmental laws and regulations at our global operations, including legal proceedings and related costs, and reclamation matters, see below as well as Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Notes 1, 10 and 11. Table of Contents 6 United States. There are a number of federal and state environmental laws and regulations that apply to our properties and may affect our operations. Laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA) and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations, or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we previously sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. Other federal and comparable state environmental laws have affected, or could in the future affect, us including, but not limited to, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. We have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by FMC and certain of its affiliates. Our operations are subject to state regulations governing mine closures and reclamation. Closure plans are required to be updated every six years in Arizona and every five years in New Mexico and Colorado. We are also required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. Most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction, depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under CERCLA or similar state laws. Regulations have been, and may in the future be, considered at various governmental levels to increase financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation. Further, there has been consideration of reforms to federal mining laws, including enhancement of laws, regulations and policies governing financial assurance, which if ever enacted, may be applicable to us.

Further, there has been consideration of reforms to federal mining laws, including enhancement of laws, regulations and policies governing financial assurance, which if ever enacted, may be applicable to us. Our U.S. mining operations are also subject to regulations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that are intended to protect species listed by the Department of the Interior’s Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) as endangered or threatened, along with critical habitat designated by FWS for these listed species. The ESA may affect the ability of landowners, including us, to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations, and may also affect our ability to obtain, retain or deliver water to some operations. New or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial assurance discussed above and in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” For example, in May 2024, EPA amended its rule establishing standards for hazardous air pollutant emissions from primary copper smelters. This final rule will impact our Miami, Arizona smelter operations, which process a significant portion of the copper concentrate produced by our North America copper mines. We are evaluating processes and equipment modifications and the costs involved, which could be significant in connection with the revised rule requirements. Our appeal of EPA’s final rule to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is suspended pending resolution of several petitions for reconsideration to the EPA filed by us and other parties. EPA and state agencies continue to consider regulations for man-made organic compounds that could be present in soil, groundwater and surface water at our existing and former operations. These regulations may include drinking water standards, hazardous waste requirements, and hazardous substance designations for Perfluorooctanesulfonic and Perfluorooctanoic acids. In January 2024, EPA announced through guidance that, effective immediately, it lowered the recommended screening levels for investigation and cleanup of lead in residential soils, and in January 2025, EPA published its final toxicological assessment for inorganic arsenic, which may be used to calculate cleanup levels at state and federal remediation sites and may lead to regulatory guidance, rulemaking and other regulatory activities. We are working with state agencies to understand possible ramifications of this guidance to our projects. This EPA guidance and future changes to EPA’s lead and arsenic cleanup levels could result in increases to our environmental reserves for ongoing residential property cleanup projects near former smelter sites. In 2023, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a final rule to amend the final revised definition of the “waters of the United States.” Although future court decisions may further affect the scope of the final rule and legal challenges have already been successful, we may need federal authorization under the Clean Water Act to expand some of our operations.

Table of Contents 7 Peru. The General Environmental Law (Law No. 28611) establishes the main environmental guidelines and principles applicable in Peru. Pursuant to the General Environmental Law, Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM) issued national environmental regulations, which have gradually replaced prior guidelines governing governmental agencies’ environmental competencies. The Environmental Evaluation and Oversight Agency has the authority to inspect mining operations and fine companies that fail to comply with prescribed environmental regulations and their approved environmental assessments. Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by MINEM. Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, Cerro Verde submitted its updated closure plan and cost estimates and received approval from MINEM in December 2023. The Cerro Verde mine has developed and continues to implement detailed, comprehensive mine waste and tailings management programs to meet the applicable Peru waste regulations and our environmental management practices. These programs incorporate commitments included in the Environmental and Social Impact Studies and the engineer of record designs for the specific cases of tailings storage facilities and certain leach pad stockpiles. For any future projects, including for existing facilities, Cerro Verde also may be required by MINEM or the National Environmental Certification Service for Sustainable Investments to incur additional costs to comply with the requirements of new regulations that provide for the adequacy of the transportation and final disposal of tailings. Chile. El Abra is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Chile Mining and Geology Agency. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, El Abra is working to submit an updated plan with closure cost estimates in the second half of 2025. Indonesia. PT-FI holds multiple permits from national, provincial, and regency regulatory agencies, including groundwater use permits, effluent and air discharge permits, solid and hazardous waste storage and management permits and protection of forest borrow-to-use permits. Where permits have specific terms, renewal applications are made to the relevant regulatory authority as required, prior to the end of the permit term. In December 2018, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF) issued a revised environmental permit to PT-FI to address certain operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies. PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework known as the Tailings Management Roadmap for continuous improvement in environmental practices at PT-FI’s operations, including initiatives to potentially increase tailings retention and to evaluate large scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia.",

PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework known as the Tailings Management Roadmap for continuous improvement in environmental practices at PT-FI’s operations, including initiatives to potentially increase tailings retention and to evaluate large scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia. The third-party expert nominated by MOEF to perform the framework evaluation submitted its report to the MOEF in June 2021. In 2024, PT-FI continued to work with MOEF on the Tailings Management Roadmap objectives, including further reduction of non- tailings sediment entering the tailings management area, construction of bamboo and geotube structures in the estuary portion of the tailings management area to increase sedimentation and reduce erosion, as well as continue pursuing additional beneficial uses of tailings in infrastructure and other projects. In October 2024, MOEF approved the next phase of the Tailings Management Roadmap, which extends from 2025 to 2030 and continues activities from the initial period with additional programs and studies for continuous improvement in tailings management. In 2020, PT-FI initiated a new environmental impact analysis (called an Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan or AMDAL) in preparation for the proposed activities associated with the transition from Grasberg surface mine to underground operations, and PT-FI completed the approval requirements of the AMDAL covering all support activities for the underground transition in 2023. In December 2023, PT-FI received technical approval for its tailings management activities. In 2024, the MOEF approved an addendum to the AMDAL that covers activities associated with the conversion of PT-FI’s power plant from coal-fired to liquefied natural gas (LNG). Permitting related to the conversion to LNG continues to progress. A detailed mine closure plan and five-year reclamation plan have been approved by Indonesia regulators as required by Indonesia law. The mine closure plan is reviewed annually and required reclamation bonds are in place. In 2019, PT-FI completed and received approval on an updated mine closure plan to reflect Grasberg minerals district production operations until 2041 and PT-FI will be required to fund the next mine closure guarantee in 2025. PT-FI’s most recent five-year reclamation plan covering 2022 through 2026 was approved in early 2022. In the future, additional approval will be required for the diversion of the Aghawagon/Otomona River out of the tailings management area at the end of the mine life.

Starting in 2025, PT-FI's coal-fired power plant will be subject to a carbon emissions trade system based on reported emissions submitted to the regulators in early 2026. Refer to “Operations – Indonesia” below for discussion of PT-FI’s plans to transition its existing energy source from coal to natural gas. Regulations that affect us also may include mandated corporate climate-related reporting, including: • The SEC’s new climate-related disclosure rules, which are being challenged in federal courts. • The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which requires in scope entities to provide detailed reporting on climate change and other sustainability topics. • The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive which will require in scope entities to identify, assess and address various social and environmental topics. • California’s Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, which are being challenged in federal courts, and Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosures Act, which were enacted in 2023. Legislation similar to California’s is also under consideration in other states. While it is not yet possible to reasonably estimate the nature, extent, timing and cost or other impacts of any future carbon pricing mechanisms, mandatory disclosures, other climate change regulatory programs or future legislative action that may be enacted, we anticipate that we will dedicate more resources and incur more costs to comply and remediate in response to legislative or regulatory changes. For information about the risks posed by the potential impacts of climate change and related regulations, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” Health and Safety Our highest priority is the health, safety and well-being of our employees and contractors. We also work to promote our safety-first values with our suppliers and in the communities where we operate. We believe health and safety considerations are integral to, and fundamental for, all other functions in our organization, and we understand the health and safety of our workforce is critical to our operational efficiency and long-term success. We are subject to extensive U.S. and international regulation of worker health and safety, including the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions.",

For example, in the U.S., the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. In 2024, MSHA enacted the Safety Program for Surface Mobile Equipment regulation and finalized a new regulation, which reduces permissible exposure limits of respirable crystalline silica effective April 2026. Our compliance with these or any other new health and safety regulations could increase our mining costs. If we were found to be in violation of these regulations we could face penalties or restrictions that may materially and adversely affect our operations. Additionally, in the U.S., various state agencies have concurrent jurisdiction arising under state law that regulate worker health and safety in both our industrial facilities and mines. If regulatory inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures. Refer to Exhibit 95.1 to this Form 10-K for additional information regarding certain orders and citations issued by MSHA for our operations during the year ended December 31, 2024. For information about health and safety, refer to “Human Capital” below and Item 4. “Mine Safety Disclosures.” Table of Contents 9 Human Rights We are dedicated to the recognition, respect and promotion of human rights wherever we do business.

We take this obligation seriously in all aspects of our business, and we expect the same of our business partners. For information about human rights, refer to “Community and Human Rights” below. COMPETITION The top 10 producers of copper comprise approximately 40% of total worldwide mined copper production. Based on Wood Mackenzie’s December 2024 estimates, we ranked third among those producers for the year 2024, with approximately 6% of estimated total worldwide mined copper production based on net equity ownership. We believe our competitive position is based on the size, quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers. We have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies, and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment.",

We have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies, and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and we believe our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits (including the expansion of deposits at our existing mine sites); recruit, retain, develop and advance a skilled workforce; and to manage our costs. OPERATIONS Responsible Production We demonstrate our responsible production performance through the Copper Mark, a comprehensive assurance framework developed specifically for the copper industry, and recently extended to other metals including molybdenum. To achieve the Copper Mark, each site is required to complete an independent external assurance process to assess conformance with various environmental, social and governance criteria. Awarded sites must be revalidated every three years. We have achieved, and are committed to maintaining, the Copper Mark and/or Molybdenum Mark, as applicable, at all of our operating sites globally. We are also a founding member of the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM), an organization dedicated to a safe, fair and sustainable mining and metals industry, aiming continuously to strengthen performance across the global mining and metals industry. As a member company, we are required to implement the 10 Mining Principles which define good environmental, social and governance practices, and associated position statements, while also meeting 39 performance expectations. Tailings Management We dedicate substantial financial resources and internal and external technical resources to pursue the safe management of our tailings facilities and to reduce or eliminate the number of and potential consequences of credible failure modes. Our tailings management and stewardship program, which involves qualified external engineers of record and periodic oversight by an independent tailings review board and our tailings stewardship team, conform with the tailings governance framework on preventing catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities adopted by the ICMM. Further, our tailings management policy outlines our continued commitment to managing our tailings responsibly and effectively across our sites globally. As an ICMM member and in accordance with our commitment in our tailings management policy, we also have implemented the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (the Tailings Standard) for all tailings storage facilities with “Extreme” or “Very High” potential consequences based on “credible failure modes” and are committed to implementing the Tailings Standard by August 2025 for all other tailing storage facilities that have not been deemed “Safely Closed” (each as defined in the Tailings Standard). We believe we have the financial capacity to meet current estimated lifecycle costs, including estimated closure, post-closure and reclamation obligations associated with our tailings storage facilities.",

Table of Contents 10 Overview of Mines Following are maps and descriptions of our copper and molybdenum mining operations in North America, South America and Indonesia. We consider our material mines, as defined under the disclosure requirements of Subpart 1300 of SEC Regulation S-K, to be the Morenci mine in the U.S., the Cerro Verde mine in Peru and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia. Refer to Exhibits 96.1, 96.2 and 96.3 for the Technical Report Summaries that have been prepared for our material mines. North America In the U.S., most of the land occupied by our copper and molybdenum mines, concentrators, SX/EW facilities, smelter, refinery, rod mills, molybdenum roasters and processing facilities is owned by us or is located on unpatented mining claims owned by us. Certain portions of our Bagdad, Sierrita, Miami, Chino, Tyrone, Henderson and Climax operations are located on government-owned land and are operated under a Mine Plan of Operations or other use permit. We hold various federal and state permits or leases on government land for purposes incidental to mine operations. Morenci We own a 72% undivided interest in Morenci, with the remaining 28% owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Arizona, Inc. (15%) and SMM Morenci, Inc. (13%). Each partner takes in kind its share of Morenci’s production. Morenci is an open-pit copper and molybdenum mining complex that has been in continuous operation since 1939 and previously was mined through underground workings. In the 1880s, Phelps Dodge & Company (Phelps Dodge) first invested in the area, and through acquisition, consolidated all mining operations in the area by the 1920s. Phelps Dodge was acquired by FCX in 2007. Morenci is located in Greenlee County, Arizona, approximately 50 miles northeast of Safford on U.S. Highway 191. The property is located at latitude 33.07 degrees north and longitude 109.35 degrees west using the World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 coordinate system. The site is accessible by a paved highway and a railway spur.",

    "text": "“Legal Proceedings” for further discussion. Bagdad Our wholly owned Bagdad mine is an open-pit copper and molybdenum mining complex that has been in continuous operation since 1945 and prior mining was conducted through underground workings. Bagdad is located in Yavapai County in west-central Arizona, approximately 60 miles west of Prescott and 100 miles northwest of Phoenix. The property can be reached by U.S. Highway 93 to State Route 97 or Arizona Highway 96, which ends at the town of Bagdad. The closest railroad is at Hillside, Arizona, 24 miles southeast on Arizona Highway 96. The Bagdad mine is a porphyry copper deposit containing both sulfide and oxide mineralization. Chalcopyrite and molybdenite are the dominant primary sulfides and are the primary economic minerals in the mine. Chalcocite is the most common secondary copper sulfide mineral, and the predominant oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla, malachite and azurite. The Bagdad operation consists of a concentrator with a milling design capacity of 77,100 metric tons of ore per day that produces copper and molybdenum concentrate, a SX/EW plant that can produce approximately 9 million pounds per year of copper cathode from solution generated by low-grade stockpile leaching, and a pressure-leach plant to process molybdenum concentrate. The available mining fleet consists of thirty-eight 235-metric-ton haul trucks loaded by 6 electric shovels and 2 loaders with bucket sizes ranging from 30 to 48 cubic meters, which are capable of moving an average of 236,000 metric tons of material per day. In 2023, we announced a project to convert Bagdad’s fleet of haul trucks to become fully autonomous. The testing of the autonomous fleet is expected to begin in second-quarter 2025 with anticipated project completion by year-end 2025. Bagdad’s net PP&E and mine development costs at December 31, 2024, totaled $1.0 billion. Bagdad’s production totaled 146 million pounds of copper and 13 million pounds of molybdenum in 2024, 146 million pounds of copper and 10 million pounds of molybdenum in 2023, and 165 million pounds of copper and 9 million pounds of molybdenum in 2022. We have a potential expansion project to more than double the concentrator capacity of the Bagdad operation in northwest Arizona. Bagdad’s reserve life currently exceeds 80 years and supports an expanded operation. In late 2023, we completed technical and economic studies, which indicate the opportunity to construct new concentrating facilities to increase copper production by 200 to 250 million pounds per year at estimated incremental project Table of Contents 12 capital costs of approximately $3.5 billion. Expanded operations would provide improved efficiency and reduce unit net cash costs through economies of scale. Project economics indicate that the expansion would require an incentive copper price in the range of $3.50 to $4.00 per pound and approximately three to four years to complete. The decision of whether to proceed and timing of the potential expansion will take into account overall copper market conditions, availability of labor and other factors, including pending conversion of the existing haul truck fleet to autonomous to support long-range plans.",

Cerro Verde is an open-pit copper and molybdenum mining complex that has been in operation since the 1970s. Cerro Verde is located 20 miles southwest of Arequipa, Peru. Prior to being acquired in 1994 by a predecessor of Phelps Dodge, the mine was previously operated by the Peru government. The property is located at latitude 16.53 degrees south and longitude 71.58 degrees west using the WGS 84 coordinate system. The site is accessible by paved highways. Cerro Verde’s copper cathode and concentrate production that is not sold locally is transported approximately 70 miles by truck and by rail to the Port of Matarani for shipment to international markets. Molybdenum concentrate is transported by truck to either the Ports of Callao or Matarani for shipment. Table of Contents 18 The Cerro Verde mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has oxide, secondary sulfide and primary sulfide mineralization. The predominant oxide copper minerals are brochantite, chrysocolla, malachite and copper “pitch.” Chalcocite and covellite are the most important secondary copper sulfide minerals. Chalcopyrite and molybdenite are the dominant primary sulfides. Cerro Verde’s operation includes 2 concentrating facilities with an annual average permitted milling capacity of 409,500 metric tons of ore per day (and the ability to annually treat up to 10% more for a total of 450,450 metric tons of ore per day). As a result of several efficiency initiatives implemented over the past several years, in 2024, Cerro Verde’s 2 concentrators were able to achieve a combined average milling rate of 415,500 metric tons of ore per day in 2024. Cerro Verde also operates a 100,000-metric-ton-per-day ROM leach system coupled with SX/EW leaching facilities, which have a production capacity of approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year.",

Cerro Verde also operates a 100,000-metric-ton-per-day ROM leach system coupled with SX/EW leaching facilities, which have a production capacity of approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year. The available fleet consists of fifty-four 300-metric-ton haul trucks, ninety-one 250-metric-ton haul trucks (8 of which are currently on standby) and 8 leased 380-metric-ton haul trucks loaded by 14 electric shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 33 to 57 cubic meters. This fleet is capable of moving an average of approximately 1,000,000 metric tons of material per day. Cerro Verde’s net PP&E and mine development costs at December 31, 2024, totaled $5.8 billion. Cerro Verde’s production totaled 0.9 billion pounds of copper and 20 million pounds of molybdenum in 2024, 1.0 billion pounds of copper and 22 million pounds of molybdenum in 2023, and 1.0 billion pounds of copper and 23 million pounds of molybdenum in 2022. Cerro Verde is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than two inches per year and is in an active seismic zone. The highest bench elevation is 2,768 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1,538 meters above sea level. The Peru general mining law and Cerro Verde’s mining stability agreement grant the surface rights of mining concessions located on government land. Government land obtained after 1997 must be leased or purchased. Cerro Verde has a mining concession covering approximately 175,500 acres, including 61,500 acres of surface rights and access to 14,600 acres granted through an easement from the Peru National Assets Office, plus 151 acres of owned property, and 1,065 acres of rights-of-way outside the mining concession area leased from both government agencies and private parties. Cerro Verde currently receives electrical power, including hydro-generated power, under long-term contracts with ElectroPerú S.A. and Engie Energía Peru S.A. During 2023, Cerro Verde entered into a new power purchase agreement that is expected to transition its electric power to fully renewable energy sources in 2026. Water for our Cerro Verde processing operations comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Río Chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation and from wastewater collected from the city of Arequipa and treated at a wastewater treatment plant originally constructed and currently operated by Cerro Verde. We believe the Cerro Verde operation has sufficient water sources to support current operations, but we are closely monitoring ongoing weather patterns.

Table of Contents 19 El Abra We have a 51% ownership interest in El Abra, and the remaining 49% interest is held by the state-owned copper enterprise Corporación Nacional del Cobre de Chile. El Abra is an open-pit copper mining complex that has been in operation since 1996. El Abra is located 47 miles north of Calama in Chile’s El Loa province of the northern Chilean region of Antofagasta. The site is accessible by paved highways and by rail. The El Abra mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has sulfide and oxide mineralization. The predominant primary sulfide copper minerals are bornite and chalcopyrite. There is a minor amount of secondary sulfide mineralization as chalcocite. The oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla and pseudomalachite. There are lesser amounts of copper bearing clays and tenorite. The El Abra operation consists of a SX/EW facility with a capacity of 500 million pounds of copper cathode per year from a 115,000-metric-ton-per-day crushed leach circuit and a ROM leaching operation. The available fleet consists of twenty-three 242-metric-ton haul trucks loaded by 4 electric shovels with buckets ranging in size from 29 to 41 cubic meters, which are capable of moving 217,000 metric tons of material per day. El Abra’s net PP&E and mine development costs at December 31, 2024, totaled $0.8 billion. El Abra’s copper production totaled 219 million pounds in 2024, 217 million pounds in 2023 and 202 million pounds in 2022. We have completed substantial drilling and evaluations to define a large sulfide resource that would support a potential major mill project similar to the large-scale concentrator at Cerro Verde. We are preparing data for a potential submission of an environmental impact statement by year-end 2025, subject to ongoing stakeholder engagement and economic evaluations. Preliminary estimates, which remain under review, indicate that the project economics would be supported using an incentive copper price of less than $4.00 per pound. The decision of whether to proceed and timing of the potential project will take into account overall copper market conditions, required permitting and other factors. El Abra is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone. The highest bench elevation is 4,225 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 3,340 meters above sea level. El Abra controls a total of approximately 183,700 acres of mining claims covering the ore deposit, stockpiles, process plant, and water wellfield and pipeline.

PT-FI is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia. On December 21, 2018, we completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership (the 2018 Transaction). Following the 2018 Transaction, we have a 48.76% share ownership in PT-FI and the remaining 51.24% share ownership is collectively held by PT Mineral Industri Indonesia (MIND ID), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise, and PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (formerly known as PT Indocopper Investama), which is expected to be owned by MIND ID and the provincial/regional government in Central Papua, Indonesia. IUPK. Concurrent with closing the 2018 Transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI a special mining business license (IUPK) to replace its former contract of work. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the construction of additional domestic smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041. In addition, we, as a foreign investor, have rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration. Pursuant to regulations issued during 2024, PT-FI is eligible to apply for an extension of its mining rights beyond 2041, provided certain conditions are met, including ownership of integrated downstream facilities that have entered the operational stage; domestic ownership of at least 51% and agreement with a state-owned enterprise for an additional 10% ownership; and commitments for additional exploration and increases in refining capacity, each as approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Application for extension may be submitted at any time up to one year prior to the expiration of the current IUPK.

In connection with the 2018 Transaction, PT-FI agreed to expand its domestic smelting and refining capacity. The new smelter and PT Smelting will smelt and refine copper concentrate from PT- FI, and the PMR will process anode slimes from the new smelter and PT Smelting. Once its new downstream processing facilities are operational, PT-FI’s operations will be fully integrated. Table of Contents 21 During 2024, construction of PT-FI’s new smelter in Eastern Java, Indonesia was completed. In October 2024, during start-up activities, a fire occurred that required a temporary suspension of smelting operations to complete repairs. Procurement of long-lead items is advanced and repairs are scheduled to be completed by mid-2025, and PT-FI expects ramp-up to full capacity to be achieved by year-end 2025. As part of start-up activities, PT-FI commenced gold production from its new PMR in December 2024. The PMR has the design capacity to refine all precious metals from PT-FI’s new smelter as well as from PT Smelting. Pursuant to the terms of its IUPK regarding force majeure events, PT-FI has requested approval from the Indonesia government to permit exports of copper concentrate in 2025 until the required repairs of its new smelter following the October 2024 fire incident and full ramp-up are complete. Based on discussions with the Indonesia government, PT-FI expects to re-commence exports of copper concentrate during first-quarter 2025, and pursuant to current regulations, would be required to pay a 7.5% export duty on all copper concentrate exports during 2025.

PT-FI operates in the remote highlands of the Sudirman Mountain Range in the province of Central Papua, Indonesia, which is on the western half of the island of New Guinea. Since 1967, we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in the approximately 24,600-acre operating area. The operating area is accessible by coastal portsite facilities on the Arafura Sea and by the Timika airport. The project site is located at latitude 4.08 degrees south and longitude 137.12 degrees east using the WGS 84 coordinate system. The project area includes a 70-mile main service road from portsite to the mill complex. PT- FI’s net PP&E and mine development costs at December 31, 2024, including the new downstream processing facilities, totaled $21.1 billion. Production from the Grasberg minerals district totaled 1.8 billion pounds of copper and 1.9 million ounces of gold in 2024, 1.7 billion pounds of copper and 2.0 million ounces of gold in 2023, and 1.6 billion pounds of copper and 1.8 million ounces of gold in 2022. Over a multi-year investment period, PT-FI has successfully commissioned three large-scale underground mines in the Grasberg minerals district (Grasberg Block Cave, Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) and Big Gossan). Milling rates for ore from these underground mines averaged 208,400 metric tons of ore per day in 2024, 198,300 metric tons of ore per day in 2023 and 192,600 metric tons of ore per day in 2022. Production from these underground mines is expected to continue through 2041 and an extension of PT-FI’s operating rights beyond 2041 would extend the lives of these mines. In December 2024, PT-FI completed construction of a new copper cleaner circuit, a mill recovery project to enhance recoveries and optimize concentrate production, with commissioning underway. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for discussion of risks associated with development projects and underground mines. PT-FI plans to transition its existing energy source from coal to natural gas, which would meaningfully reduce PT- FI’s Scope 1 GHG emissions at the Grasberg minerals district. The majority of PT-FI’s planned investments in a new gas-fired combined cycle facility are expected to be incurred over the next three years, at a cost of approximately $1 billion, which represents an incremental cost of $0.4 billion compared to previously planned investments to refurbish the existing coal units. Once complete, PT-FI’s dual-fuel power plant and the new gas-fired combined cycle facility will be fueled by natural gas, supplied by a floating liquefied natural gas storage and regassification unit.

Undercutting, drawbell construction and ore extraction activities in the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine continue to track expectations. As of December 31, 2024, the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine had 469 open drawbells. Ore milled from the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine averaged 133,800 metric tons per day in 2024, 117,300 metric tons per day in 2023 and 103,300 metric tons per day in 2022. Table of Contents 22 The Grasberg Block Cave fleet consists of approximately 530 pieces of mobile equipment. The primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 96 LHD units and 16 haul trucks. Each production LHD unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore and transfers ore into the rail haulage system. The Grasberg Block Cave has an automated rail haulage system currently operating with 14 locomotives and 143 ore wagons that haul the ore to 3 gyratory crushers located underground. Each ore wagon typically carries 35 metric tons. The crushed ore is conveyed to surface stockpiles for processing. DMLZ Underground Mine The DMLZ ore body lies below the depleted Deep Ore Zone underground mine at the 2,590-meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the Ertsberg East Skarn system and neighboring Ertsberg porphyry. Hydraulic fracturing operations have been effective in managing rock stresses and pre-conditioning the cave following mining-induced seismic activity experienced from time to time. As of December 31, 2024, the DMLZ underground mine had 174 open drawbells. Ore milled from the DMLZ underground mine averaged 64,900 metric tons per day in 2024, 75,900 metric tons per day in 2023 and 76,300 metric tons per day in 2022. The DMLZ fleet consists of approximately 310 pieces of mobile equipment, which includes 59 LHD units and 26 haul trucks used in production and development activities.

Kucing Liar Underground Mine Long-term mine development activities are ongoing for PT-FI’s Kucing Liar deposit in the Grasberg minerals district. Kucing Liar is expected to produce over 7 billion pounds of copper and 6 million ounces of gold between 2029 and the end of 2041, and an extension of PT-FI’s operating rights beyond 2041 would extend the life of the project. Development activities commenced in 2022 and are expected to continue over an approximate 10-year timeframe. Capital investments for Kucing Liar are estimated to total $4 billion over the next 7 to 8 years (averaging approximately $0.5 billion per annum). Approximately $0.6 billion has been incurred through December 31, 2024. At full operating rates, annual production from Kucing Liar is expected to approximate 560 million pounds of copper and 520 thousand ounces of gold, providing PT-FI with sustained long-term, large-scale and low-cost production. Kucing Liar will benefit from substantial shared infrastructure and PT-FI’s experience and long-term success in block-cave mining. Description of Indonesia Ore Bodies. Our Indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the Grasberg monzodiorite and the Ertsberg diorite. The host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the Sudirman Range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them. The igneous-hosted ore bodies (the Grasberg Block Cave and portions of the DMLZ) occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides, dominated by chalcopyrite and, to a lesser extent, bornite. The sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies (portions of the DMLZ and Kucing Liar and all of the Big Gossan) occur as “magnetite-rich, calcium/magnesian skarn” replacements, whose Table of Contents 23 location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions. The copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite, but higher bornite concentrations are common. Moreover, gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies, though rarely visible to the naked eye.",

Table of Contents 24 Smelting Facilities and Other Mining Properties PT-FI’s New Downstream Processing Facilities. PT-FI’s new smelter and PT Smelting (see further discussion below) will smelt and refine copper concentrate from PT-FI, and the PMR will process anode slimes from the new smelter and PT Smelting. Once its new downstream processing facilities are operational, PT-FI’s operations will be fully integrated. PT-FI’s new greenfield smelter in Eastern Java, Indonesia has a capacity to process approximately 1.7 million metric tons of copper concentrate per year. During start-up activities, a fire occurred in October 2024, requiring a temporary suspension of smelting operations to complete repairs. Procurement of long-lead items is advanced and repairs are scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. PT-FI expects restoration, repair and replacement costs to approximate $100 million, which are expected to be mostly offset through recovery under construction insurance programs. PT-FI expects ramp-up to full capacity to be achieved by year-end 2025. As part of start-up activities, PT-FI commenced gold production from its new PMR in December 2024. PT Smelting. PT Smelting, an Indonesian joint venture between PT-FI and MMC, owns a copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. In December 2023, PT Smelting completed the expansion of its capacity by 30% to process approximately 1.3 million metric tons of copper concentrate per year. The project was funded by PT-FI with loans totaling $254 million that converted to equity effective June 30, 2024, increasing PT-FI’s ownership in PT Smelting to 66% from 39.5%. As discussed in Note 2, PT-FI continues to account for its investment in PT Smelting under the equity method. Beginning in 2023, PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting changed from a copper concentrate sales agreement to a tolling arrangement. Under the arrangement, PT-FI pays PT Smelting a tolling fee (which PT-FI records as production costs in the consolidated statements of income) to smelt and refine its copper concentrate and PT-FI retains title to all products for sale to unaffiliated third parties (i.e., there are no further sales to PT Smelting).

PT Smelting’s copper anode production from its smelter totaled 398,200 metric tons in 2024, 251,300 metric tons in 2023 and 316,700 metric tons in 2022. Copper cathode production from its refinery totaled 335,200 metric tons in 2024, 212,000 metric tons in 2023 and 268,400 metric tons in 2022. PT Smelting’s major scheduled maintenance turnarounds (which approximate 30 days to complete) are expected to occur every two years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. PT Smelting completed an 18-day maintenance turnaround during October 2022, a 72-day shutdown in July 2023 associated with its expansion project and a 7-day shutdown in November 2023 to complete final tie-in of the expansion project. The next maintenance turnaround is scheduled for mid-year 2025. Atlantic Copper. Our wholly owned Atlantic Copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the Huelva, Spain, port authorities, which are scheduled to expire in 2038. The smelter has a design capacity to process approximately 300,000 metric tons of copper per year, and the refinery has a capacity to process 286,000 metric tons of copper per year. Atlantic Copper’s copper anode production from its smelter totaled 247,600 metric tons in 2024, 261,900 metric tons in 2023 and 215,000 metric tons in 2022. Copper cathode production from its refinery totaled 254,400 metric tons in 2024, 260,300 metric tons in 2023 and 218,400 metric tons in 2022. During 2024, Atlantic Copper purchased 30% of its concentrate from our copper mining operations (15% from South America operations, 13% from Indonesia operations and 2% from the North America copper mines) and 70% from third parties. Atlantic Copper’s major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years, with shorter-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. Atlantic Copper completed a 17-day maintenance turnaround in 2024 and a 78-day major maintenance turnaround in 2022. Atlantic Copper is developing an e-material recycling project as a result of the significant and continued growth in electronic waste material. Atlantic Copper’s existing smelting and refining facilities provide synergies to recycle this type of material, and the project, which is expected to commence operations in 2026, would include an addition of a smelting furnace and associated equipment to recover copper, gold, silver, palladium, tin, nickel and Table of Contents 25 platinum from electronic materials. Atlantic Copper estimates that the initial project capital will approximate $435 million. Miami Smelter. We own and operate a smelter at our Miami mining operation in Arizona.

The smelter has been operating for over 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies, improve production and comply with air quality requirements. The Miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our North America copper mines. Concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 840,600 metric tons in 2024, 810,900 metric tons in 2023 and 781,000 metric tons in 2022, and copper anode production from the smelter totaled 214,000 metric tons in 2024, 222,000 metric tons in 2023 and 202,000 metric tons in 2022. In addition, because sulfuric acid is a by-product of smelting concentrate, the Miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulfuric acid for our North America leaching operations. Major maintenance turnarounds are anticipated to occur approximately every three to four years for the Miami smelter. We performed a major maintenance turnaround during 2021 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for mid-year 2025, for which we expect to incur maintenance charges and idle facility costs of approximately $85 million. Rod & Refining Operations. Our Rod & Refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in North America, including a refinery in El Paso, Texas, and rod mills in El Paso, Texas and Miami, Arizona. We refine our copper anode production from our Miami smelter at our El Paso refinery. The El Paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of approximately 410,000 metric tons of copper cathode, which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our Miami smelter. Copper cathode production from the El Paso refinery totaled 221,300 metric tons in 2024, 217,800 metric tons in 2023 and 208,900 metric tons in 2022. Our El Paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate, copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold, silver, platinum and palladium. Molybdenum Conversion Facilities. We process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the U.S. and Europe into such products as technical-grade molybdic oxide, ferromolybdenum, pure molybdic oxide, ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide. We operate molybdenum roasters in Sierrita, Arizona; Fort Madison, Iowa; and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and we operate a molybdenum pressure-leach plant in Bagdad, Arizona. We also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in Stowmarket, United Kingdom. Other North America Copper Mines. We have five non-operating copper mines – Ajo, Bisbee, Tohono, Twin Buttes and Christmas, which are located in Arizona – that have been on care and maintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies, new permits, and additional capital investment, which could be significant, to return them to operating status. MINING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES In 2024, capital expenditures totaled $4.8 billion (including $2.1 billion for major mining projects – primarily for underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district – and $1.2 billion for PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities). We have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes, extend mine lives and develop large-scale underground ore bodies.",

We have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes, extend mine lives and develop large-scale underground ore bodies. As further discussed in MD&A, our near-term major development projects will focus on the underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district. Considering the long-term nature and large size of our development projects, actual costs and timing could vary from estimates. Additionally, in response to market conditions, the timing of our expenditures will continue to be reviewed. We continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves. Additionally, based on the current reserve life through 2041, full development of PT-FI’s underground mineral reserves at the Grasberg minerals district is expected to require approximately $4 billion (most of which will be incurred over the next 8 years) of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore from the Grasberg Block Cave, DMLZ and Kucing Liar deposits. Increases in power loads at these processing facilities and the underground mines are expected to require additional power generation and as such, PT-FI is planning investments in a new gas-fired combined cycle facility. The majority of PT-FI’s planned Table of Contents 26 investments in a new gas-fired combined cycle facility are expected to be incurred over the next three years, at a cost of approximately $1 billion, which represents an incremental cost of $0.4 billion compared to previously planned investments to refurbish the existing coal units. Once complete, PT-FI’s dual-fuel power plant and the new gas-fired combined cycle facility will be fueled by natural gas, supplied by a floating liquefied natural gas storage and regassification unit. In 2024, exploration spending associated with our mining operations totaled $113 million. Our mining exploration activities are primarily associated with our existing mines, focusing on opportunities to expand mineral reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity. Exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions at our existing properties. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion of risks associated with mine development projects and exploration activities, and PT-FI’s IUPK.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY, NATURAL RESOURCES AND RAW MATERIALS Our copper mining operations require significant amounts of energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. In 2024, energy represented 16% of our copper mine site operating costs, including purchases of approximately 270 million gallons of diesel fuel; approximately 8,550 gigawatt hours of electricity at our North America and South America copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our Indonesia mining operation); approximately 750 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in Indonesia; and approximately 2 million MMBtu (million British thermal units) of natural gas at certain of our North America mines. Based on current cost estimates, energy is expected to approximate 16% of our copper mine site operating costs for the year 2025. Our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. The loss of water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights, could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations. For a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water, refer to “Governmental Regulations” above, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.” Sulfuric acid is used in the SX/EW process and is produced as a by-product of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the Safford mine. Sulfuric acid needs in excess of the sulfuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties. For further discussion of risks associated with various input costs, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” HUMAN CAPITAL We are committed to promoting the health, safety and well-being of our workforce and striving to further strengthen our commitment to promoting an inclusive, diverse and agile workplace.

Our culture of leading by example at all levels of the organization and our Safe Production Matters strategy underpin our Fatal Risk Management (FRM) program. The goal of our FRM program is to achieve zero workplace fatalities by strengthening preventative measures and raising awareness to fatal risks and the measures necessary to mitigate them. We further seek to prevent fatalities and high-risk incidents by leveraging technology to support safe work practices in the field and data analytics to identify opportunities for improvement. Our framework for managing risks and compliance obligations is certified company-wide in accordance with the ISO 45001 Health and Safety Management System (ISO 45001), most recently certified in January 2023. ISO 45001 requires third-party site-level verification of requirements, with an overall goal of preventing fatalities and reducing safety incidents. As part of our commitment to providing a healthy and safe workplace, we strive to provide the training, tools and resources needed so our workforce can identify risks and consistently apply effective controls. We share information and key learnings about potential fatal events (PFEs), high-risk incidents and best practices throughout the company, and we engage with industry peers and professional organizations to learn and continuously improve our health and safety program. Our corporate team communicates safety performance to executive management regularly, including reviews of high-risk, potential fatal and fatal incidents. The CRC provides input on the overall direction of our health and safety programs and reviews safety statistics, trends and incident investigation reports. In the event of a fatal incident, executive management and the Chair of the CRC are notified immediately, and we review and discuss all fatal incident investigations with the CRC and the Board. Our objective is to achieve zero workplace fatalities and to decrease injuries and occupational illnesses. We measure our safety performance through regularly established benchmarks, including the industry-established Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), and our company-established PFEs, both of which include employees and contractors company-wide. Regrettably, we had two work-related fatalities in 2024 and one work-related fatality in Table of Contents 28 2023. In addition, we had 30 PFEs in 2024 and 46 PFEs in 2023.

Table of Contents 29 COMMUNITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS We have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations. In addition, global regulations with regard to human rights and environmental due diligence in supply chains require us to identify, and to prevent, or at least mitigate, adverse impacts on human rights and the environment. We continue to make significant expenditures on community development, health, education, training and cultural programs, which include: • comprehensive job training programs • clean water and sanitation projects • public health programs, including malaria control • agricultural assistance programs • small and medium enterprise development programs • basic education programs • advanced education scholarships • cultural resources promotion and preservation programs • community infrastructure development • charitable donations In 2000, we endorsed the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign Office Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (Voluntary Principles). We participated in developing these Voluntary Principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our Human Rights Policy. The Voluntary Principles provide guidelines for our security programs, including interaction with host- government security personnel, private security contractors and our internal security employees. Our Human Rights Policy reflects our commitment to implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We conduct site-level human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) at our global operations, which help us to embed human rights considerations into our business practices. We completed HRIAs at Cerro Verde in 2024, our PT-FI Grasberg operations in 2023, Arizona operations in 2022, El Abra in 2021 and New Mexico operations in 2018. We are at the mid-way point of our HRIA at PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities and plan to initiate our HRIA at our Colorado operations later in 2025. We continue to participate in a multi- industry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies and experts in the field to learn how best practices are evolving.

In 2015, Cerro Verde completed construction of a wastewater treatment plant for the city of Arequipa, which, in addition to supplementing existing water supplies to support Cerro Verde’s concentrator expansion, also improves the local water quality, enhances agriculture products grown in the area and reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses. In addition to these projects, Cerro Verde annually makes significant community development investments in the Arequipa region. Security Matters. Consistent with our operating permits in Peru and our commitment to protect our employees and property, we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment.

Both employees and contractors perform functions such as protecting company facilities, monitoring shipments of supplies and products, assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations. The security department receives human rights and Voluntary Principles training annually. Cerro Verde’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled $8 million in both 2024 and 2023 and $7 million in 2022. Cerro Verde, like all businesses and residents of Peru, relies on the Peru government for the maintenance of public order, upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property. The Peru government is responsible for employing police personnel and directing their operations. Cerro Verde has limited public security forces in support of its operation, with the arrangement defined through an Inter-institutional Cooperation Agreement with the Peru National Police.

PT-FI provides funding and technical assistance to support various community development programs in areas such as health, education, economic development and local infrastructure. In 1996, PT-FI established a social investment fund with the aim of contributing to social and economic development in the Mimika Regency. Prior to 2019, the fund was mainly managed by the Amungme and Kamoro Community Development Organization, a community-led institution. In 2019, a new foundation, the Amungme and Kamoro Community Empowerment Foundation (Yayasan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Amungme dan Kamoro, or YPMAK), was established, and in 2020, PT-FI appointed YPMAK to assist in distributing a significant portion of PT-FI’s funding to support the development and empowerment of the local Indigenous Papuan people. YPMAK is governed by a Board of Governors consisting of seven representatives, including four from PT-FI. In addition, since 2001, PT-FI has voluntarily established and contributed to land rights trust funds administered by Amungme and Kamoro representatives that focus on socioeconomic initiatives, human rights and environmental issues. PT-FI is committed to the continued funding of YPMAK programs and the land rights trust funds, as well as other local-community development initiatives, making annual investments in public health, education, and local economic development. PT-FI recorded charges totaling $141 million in 2024 and $123 million in both 2023 and 2022 to production and delivery costs for social and economic development programs. Security Matters.

PT-FI, like all businesses and residents of Indonesia, relies on the Indonesia government for the maintenance of public order, upholding the rule of law and protection of personnel and property. The Grasberg minerals district has been designated by the Indonesia government as one of Indonesia’s national vital objects. This designation results in the police and, to a lesser extent, the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations. The Indonesia government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations. As part of pre-deployment, all military and police personnel receive human rights training.",

The Indonesia government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations. As part of pre-deployment, all military and police personnel receive human rights training. From the outset of PT-FI’s operations, the Indonesia government has looked to PT-FI to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the Indonesia government and the remote location of and lack of development in the province of Central Papua. PT-FI’s financial support of the Indonesia government security institutions assigned to PT-FI’s operations area represents a prudent response to PT-FI’s requirements and commitments to protect its workforce and property, better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol PT-FI’s roads and secure its area of operations. In addition, the provision of such support is consistent with our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and reflects our commitment to pursue practices that protect and respect human rights. Table of Contents 31 PT-FI’s support costs for the government-provided security totaled $24 million in 2024 and $25 million in both 2023 and 2022.

Proven and probable mineral reserves were determined from the application of relevant modifying factors to geological data to establish an operational, economically viable mine plan. The estimates are based on mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry. Mineral reserves, as used in the mineral reserve data presented here, means the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted. Proven mineral reserves mean the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource, from geological evidence revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes with grades and/or quality estimates from detailed, closely spaced sampling, and geologic characterization that defines the size, shape, depth and mineral content to a high degree of confidence. Probable mineral reserves means the economically mineable part of an indicated mineral resource, for which quantity and grade are estimated from information similar to that used for measured mineral resources where the samples are farther apart, and the geological characterization is adequate. Probable mineral reserves can also include remaining portions of a measured mineral resource. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven mineral reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees. These estimates are reviewed and verified regularly by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve determination. Our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to evaluate economic values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Refer to Item 1A.",

We revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves. Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2024, were determined using metal price assumptions of $3.25 per pound for copper, $1,600 per ounce for gold and $12.00 per pound for molybdenum. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, LME copper settlement prices averaged $4.00 per pound, London PM gold prices averaged $2,044 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Platts Metals Daily averaged $21.41 per pound. Table of Contents 34 The estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recoveries and smelter recoveries, where applicable.

Excludes the El Abra mill project discussed in “Operations – South America” (estimated potential addition of approximately 20 billion recoverable pounds of copper in concentrate and cathode). c. Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves from Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the life of the IUPK in 2041. We believe an extension would provide additional material reserves. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of PT-FI’s IUPK. d. Consolidated mineral reserves represent estimated metal quantities after reduction for joint venture partner interests at the Morenci mine in North America (refer to Note 2 for further discussion of our Morenci joint venture). Excluded from the table above are our estimated recoverable proven and probable silver reserves of 318 million ounces, which were determined using $20 per ounce. e.

See the 2024 Technical Report Summary of Mineral Reserves and Resources for the Cerro Verde mine dated December 31, 2024, filed as Exhibit 96.1 to this Form 10-K. In defining our open-pit mineral reserves, we apply an “operational cutoff grade” strategy, wherein multiple processing options, throughput constraints, mine development and ore availability are given consideration to maximize the value of our operations. In defining our open-pit mineral resources, internal cutoff grades are applied. The internal cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to cover estimated processing and administrative costs. We use “break-even cutoff grades” to define the in-situ mineral reserves and resources for our underground ore bodies. The break-even cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to cover all estimated operating and administrative costs associated with our production. Our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals, such as gold, molybdenum and silver. We value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade. Copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms of one metal. The calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as used for reserve or resource determination, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties. Our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade.

Our proven and probable mineral reserves in Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will comply with its obligations under the IUPK and receive the second 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041 (refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Note 11 for further discussion). We develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies. Significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the life-of-mine plans reflected below. a. The ultimate timing of the start of production at Kucing Liar is dependent upon a number of factors and may vary from the date shown here. Refer to \"Operations – Indonesia\" for further discussion. Mill and Leach Stockpiles Mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating, smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities. Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recoveries for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing.",

Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recoveries for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Table of Contents 41 Expected copper recoveries for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large- scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 80% depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80% of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Processes and copper recoveries for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery estimates are adjusted annually based on new information and as related technology and processing methods change. Based on our annual review of mill and leach stockpiles, we increased our estimated consolidated recoverable copper in certain leach stockpiles, net of joint venture interests, by 164 million pounds in 2024, primarily associated with Morenci leach stockpiles, partly offset by a decrease for Safford leach stockpiles.

Table of Contents 42 Mineral Resources In addition to mineral reserves, our properties contain mineral resources that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant. However, permitting and significant capital expenditures may be required before mining of these resources could commence at these properties. A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves until engineering, legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development and operating costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors. Mineral resources include measured, indicated and inferred mineral classifications. • A measured mineral resource is a resource for which the quantity and grade are estimated from detailed, closely spaced sampling, and geologic characterization that defines the size, shape, depth and mineral content to a high degree of confidence. • An indicated mineral resource is a resource for which quantity and grade are estimated from information similar to that used for measured mineral resources where the samples are farther apart, and the geological characterization is adequate. • An inferred mineral resource is a resource for which quantity and grade are estimated from information similar to that used for measured and indicated mineral resources, but with limited geological evidence and sampling. Inferred mineral resource grade and mineralization continuity have a lower degree of confidence. Our estimates of mineral resources have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of Subpart 1300 of SEC Regulation S-K. No assurance can be given that the estimated mineral resources not included in mineral reserves will become proven and probable mineral reserves. Estimated mineral resources as presented on the following pages were assessed using prices of $3.75 per pound for copper, $1,700 per ounce for gold, $15 per pound for molybdenum and $20 per ounce for silver. Cutoff grade strategy and expected recoveries used to evaluate mineral resources are consistent with those for mineral reserves but would require additional work to substantiate.

For additional information regarding recent macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, see the risk factor below regarding the price and availability of consumables and components we purchase and constraints on supply and logistics, and transportation services. There has been a history of significant volatility in the commodities markets, including the copper market. Fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand and inventory levels; global economic and political conditions (such as election results, level of economic growth, or recession and political or geopolitical tensions and conflicts); national and international regulatory, trade and/or tax policies, including tariffs and other controls on imports and exports; commodities investment activity and speculation; interest rates; current inflation rates and expectations regarding future inflation rates; the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology. Volatility in global economic growth, particularly in developing economies, has the potential to affect adversely future demand and prices for commodities. Geopolitical uncertainty and protectionism can inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence, which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to deal in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility. For additional information regarding the historical fluctuations of the prices of copper, gold and molybdenum, refer to “Markets” in MD&A. In addition to the factors discussed above, copper prices may be affected by demand from China, which is currently the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, including as a result of geopolitical uncertainty and tension between the U.S. and China as well as uncertainties about China’s economy. Copper demand and prices also may be affected by industry production, substitution, and thrifting. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, or other governmental action related to tariffs and other controls on imports and exports or trade agreements or policies are difficult to predict and could adversely affect copper prices, demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers and the global economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",

The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, or other governmental action related to tariffs and other controls on imports and exports or trade agreements or policies are difficult to predict and could adversely affect copper prices, demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers and the global economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We believe long-term fundamentals for copper are favorable with growing demand supported by copper’s critical role in the global transition to renewable power, electric vehicles and other carbon-reduction initiatives, continued urbanization in developing countries, data center and artificial intelligence (AI) developments and growing connectivity globally; however if these markets, industries and transitions do not develop as we expect, or develop more slowly than we expect, future demand and prices for copper may be negatively affected, impacting our business. Copper demand and prices also may be affected by inadequate investment in and limited production from existing copper mining operations, and copper demand globally, including North America, Europe, and Asian countries other than China. Additional factors affecting gold prices may include purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from China and India, two of the world’s largest consumers of gold, and global demand for jewelry containing gold. If market prices for the primary commodities we produce were to decline and remain low for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing or modifying our mining and processing operations, as we have done in the past, and our cash flows, ability to return capital to shareholders and capital expenditure plans could be negatively affected. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, in which case we may incur losses, and those losses may be material. Declines in prices of commodities we sell could also result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our long-lived assets. Fluctuations in the price and availability of consumables and components for key machines and equipment we purchase, and constraints on supply and logistics could affect our profitability and operating plans. Further, significant delays or increases in costs affecting transportation services may affect our business. Consumables and components for key machines and equipment we purchase are subject to price volatility caused by global economic factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures, inflation and economic slowdown or recession, as well as fuel and energy costs (for example, the price of diesel), the impact of interruption by fire, power shortages, industrial accidents, hostile acts, cybersecurity attacks, natural disasters or extreme weather events, major public health crises, geopolitical tensions or conflicts (including trade policies such as tariffs and other controls on exports and imports), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.",

Table of Contents 49 Prices of consumables used in our operations, such as natural gas, diesel, coal, other sources of energy, ammonium nitrate, chemical reagents (including sulfuric acid), and steel-related products, and components impact the costs of production at our operations and the costs of development projects. These prices fluctuate and can be volatile. Since 2022, we have experienced price volatility for certain consumables, including diesel fuel, ammonium nitrate and sulfuric acid, and certain components, which has impacted our operating results, and we may experience volatility in the price and availability of other consumables in the future. We also experienced increased costs for equipment, parts and other operating supplies and services. Significant volatility or further increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in material changes to our operating plans or development projects. Ensuring continuity of supply of such consumables to our operations is critical to our business. We also rely on the availability of components from suppliers for key machines and equipment, which may be impacted by competition demands as well as the availability of input materials in the creation of such equipment. A supplier’s failure to supply consumables or components in a timely manner or to meet our quality, quantity, cost requirements or our technical specifications, or our inability to obtain alternative sources of consumables or components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could adversely affect our operations. We have also experienced longer lead times on delivery of certain consumables, including fuel, lubricants, ammonium nitrate and sulfuric acid. While these delays did not significantly impact our results for the three years ended December 31, 2024, these delays may continue and could become material. Further, delays and logistical constraints may occur as a result of weather-related impacts or violence, civil and religious strife, and activism at or near our operations or those of our suppliers, as described in the related risk factor below. Following any interruption to our business, we can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.",

Following any interruption to our business, we can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Because we may rely on limited sources and long-lead times for consumables and components for key machines and equipment, a business interruption affecting or requiring such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to us. Our business depends on timely inbound transportation of consumables and components we use and outbound transportation of the commodities we produce such as by truck, rail and ocean freight. Any significant increase in the cost of or significant delays in the transportation of consumables or components used in our operations or the commodities we produce, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, weather-related impacts (such as low water levels along shipping routes) or otherwise, could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, if transportation service providers fail to deliver consumables or components used in our operations to us or the commodities we produce to our customers in a timely manner or at all, such failure could adversely impact our ability to meet our production schedules, delay our projects and capital initiatives, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility. At December 31, 2024, our total consolidated debt was $8.9 billion (see MD&A and Note 6) and our total consolidated cash and cash equivalents was $3.9 billion ($4.7 billion including restricted cash and cash equivalents associated with PT-FI’s export proceeds required to be temporarily deposited in Indonesia banks as described in MD&A and Note 10). We also have various other financial commitments, including reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. Although we have been successful in servicing debt in the past, refinancing our bank facilities and issuing new debt securities in capital markets transactions at the parent and subsidiary levels, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. In addition, we may incur additional debt in future periods or reduce our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in connection with funding existing operations, capital expenditures, dividends, share or debt repurchases, or in pursuing other business opportunities.

For further information, see the risk factors below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and the increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders and other third parties, including creditors, with respect to our environmental and social practices, performance and disclosures. Our level of indebtedness, restricted cash and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following: • Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate; • Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, financial, industry and regulatory conditions; Table of Contents 50 • Limiting our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate requirements and/ or material contingencies, to engage in future development activities or other business opportunities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt; • Requiring us to sell assets to reduce debt; or • Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments. Any failure to comply with the financial and/or other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt, which in turn may trigger cross- acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. Our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that may be accelerated upon an event of default. As of January 31, 2025, our senior unsecured debt was rated “Baa2” with a stable outlook by Moody’s Investors Service, “BBB” with a stable outlook by Fitch Ratings, and “BBB-” with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s. If we are unable to maintain our indebtedness and financial ratios at levels acceptable to these credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects deteriorate, our current credit ratings could be downgraded, which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities and existing debt, our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms and could increase our borrowing costs. Changes in or the failure to comply with the requirements of mine closure and reclamation regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so.",

We are required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. As of December 31, 2024, our financial assurance obligations totaled $2.0 billion for closure and reclamation costs of U.S. mining sites. We are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas properties and certain of our previously sold oil and gas properties under both state and federal laws. Refer to Note 10 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations and Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties” for a discussion of certain of such U.S. federal and state laws and regulations applicable to us. A substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by guarantees by us and certain of our subsidiaries. Our ability to continue to provide guarantees depends on state and other regulatory requirements, our financial performance and our financial condition. Other forms of assurance, such as letters of credit and surety bonds, are costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Failure to provide or maintain the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties. Plans and provisions for mine closure, reclamation and remediation and oil and gas properties plugging and abandonment obligations may change over time as a result of changes in stakeholder and other third-party expectations, legislation, standards, and technical understanding and techniques, which may cause our actual costs of closure, reclamation and remediation and plugging and abandonment obligations to be higher than estimated for asset retirement obligations (AROs) and environmental obligations and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. For example, our implementation of the Global Industry Standard for Tailings Management (the Tailings Standard) (refer to Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties” for further discussion) has required changes and could require additional changes to our closure and reclamation plans or modifications to previously completed reclamation actions. In addition, climate change could lead to changes in the physical risks posed to our operations, which could result in changes in our closure and reclamation plans to address such risks. Any modifications to our closure and reclamation plans that may be required to address physical climate risks may increase our financial assurance obligations and may materially increase the actual costs associated with implementing closure and reclamation at any or all of our active or inactive mine sites or smelter sites. Refer to Notes 1 and 10 for further discussion of our environmental obligations and AROs and see the risk factors below relating to the potential physical impacts of climate change and our related obligations as part of our commitment to implementing the Tailings Standard.",

Table of Contents 51 Unanticipated legal proceedings or negative developments in pending legal proceedings or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental matters, including those described in Note 10, Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties” and in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.” We are also involved periodically in other reviews, inquiries, investigations and proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. For example, we have been cooperating with and responding to a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and an information request from the Department of Justice related to our public disclosures about the engineering design and construction of the new smelter in Indonesia, which is also the subject matter in a separate whistleblower complaint from a former contractor that we are defending before the Department of Labor. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and the outcome of any legal proceeding is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties, other sanctions or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs, some of which may not be covered by insurance. Further, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against legal proceedings or responding to investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management.",

Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against legal proceedings or responding to investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle legal proceedings and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that legal proceedings will not occur. From time to time, we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental response costs and obligations at “Superfund” and other sites. We may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third-party sites or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future. For further discussion of our environmental obligations, see the regulatory, environmental and social risks below. Further, we are a global business with operations in various jurisdictions. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the U.S. or in enforcing the judgment of a foreign court or arbitral panel against a sovereign nation. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels, including against a sovereign nation, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. As a global business, we are subject to income, royalty, transaction and other taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Uncertainties exist with respect to our tax liabilities, including those arising from changes in laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Additionally, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the tax amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement occurs.

These NOLs are available to offset future regular taxable income, which we believe will result in minimal estimated regular income tax liability in the U.S. over the next several years at current metals market prices. As discussed in MD&A and Note 9, the provisions of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Act) became applicable to us on January 1, 2023. The Act includes, among other provisions, a new Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average annual AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three- year period. In September 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued proposed regulations that provide guidance on the application of CAMT, which are not final and subject to change. Based on the proposed guidance Table of Contents 52 released by the IRS, we have determined that the provisions of the Act did not impact our financial results for the years 2024 or 2023. In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published a framework for Pillar Two of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules, which was designed to coordinate participating jurisdictions in updating the international tax system to ensure that large multinational companies pay a minimum level of income tax. Recommendations from the OECD regarding a global minimum income tax and other changes are being considered and/or implemented in jurisdictions where we operate. At current metals market prices, we do not expect enactment of the recommended framework in jurisdictions where we operate to materially impact our financial results.

For example, our international operations must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. We are investigating whether activities of PT Smelting may have violated aspects of the FCPA or other laws, including laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. PT Smelting is an Indonesian joint venture between PT-FI and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (MMC). An affiliate of MMC serves as operator of PT Smelting (see Note 2). We have voluntarily Table of Contents 53 notified the SEC and Department of Justice that we have engaged outside counsel to conduct this investigation of PT Smelting’s activities. Any determination that operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws, including the FCPA, could result in the imposition of fines, penalties and equitable remedies. We cannot currently predict the outcome of the investigation. We operate in jurisdictions that have experienced public and private sector corruption and where significant anti- corruption enforcement activities, prosecutions and settlements have occurred. We have a large number of contracts with local and foreign business partners, including suppliers and contractors, who may take action contrary to or fail to adopt standards, controls and procedures, including health, safety, environmental, human rights and community standards that are equivalent to our standards, controls and procedures.

Because our operations in Indonesia are material to our business, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic, regulatory and social uncertainties in Indonesia. Maintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesia government, PT Mineral Industri Indonesia (Persero) (MIND ID), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise and shareholder in PT-FI, and the local population, is important because of the significance of our Indonesia operations to our business, and because our operations there are among Indonesia’s most significant business enterprises. Partially because of the Grasberg minerals district’s significance to Indonesia’s economy, the environmentally sensitive area where it is located, and the number of local people employed, our Indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and criticism in the Indonesia press and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. Improper management of our working relationship with the Indonesia government, MIND ID or the local population could lead to a disruption of operations and/or impact our reputation in Indonesia and in the region where we operate, which could adversely affect our business. The mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within Indonesia, and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders, some of which have conflicted with PT-FI’s contractual rights and may conflict with PT-FI’s contractual rights in the future. For example, in 2009, the Indonesia government enacted a mining law that sought to modify PT-FI’s former contract of work, certain provisions of which were not required under or conflicted with PT-FI’s former contract of work. In December 2018, PT-FI was granted an IUPK to replace its former contract of work, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041, subject to certain requirements. Refer to Note 11 for a summary of the IUPK’s key fiscal terms and requirement to develop additional smelting and refining capacity. Pursuant to regulations issued during 2024, PT-FI is eligible to apply for an extension of its mining rights beyond 2041, provided certain conditions are met. Refer to Note 10 for a summary of such conditions. Application for extension may be submitted at any time up to one year prior to the expiration of PT-FI’s IUPK. PT-FI expects to apply for an extension during 2025, pending agreement with MIND ID on a purchase and sale agreement for the transfer in 2041 of an additional 10% interest in PT-FI. We cannot guarantee that PT-FI will receive an extension of mining rights beyond 2041.

Since 2019, the Indonesia government has enacted various laws and regulations related to downstream processing of various products. Refer to “Operations – Indonesia” in MD&A and Notes 10 and 11 for a discussion of Indonesia Table of Contents 54 regulatory matters, including those related to export licenses, export duties, export proceeds, smelter assurance bonds and PT-FI’s new smelter and PMR (collectively, PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities) in Eastern Java, Indonesia. In October 2024, a fire occurred during commissioning of PT-FI’s new smelter in Eastern Java, Indonesia, requiring a temporary suspension of smelting operations to complete repairs. Procurement of long-lead items is advanced, and repairs are scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. Current regulations in Indonesia prohibit exports of copper concentrate as of January 1, 2025. Pursuant to the terms of its IUPK regarding force majeure events, PT-FI has requested approval from the Indonesia government to permit the export of copper concentrates in 2025 until the required repairs of its new smelter following the October 2024 fire incident and full ramp-up are complete. Based on discussions with the Indonesia government, PT-FI expects to re-commence exports of copper concentrate during first-quarter 2025, and pursuant to current regulations, would be required to pay a 7.5% export duty on all copper concentrate exports during 2025. If PT-FI does not receive a timely export license or if any limitations on exports or additional export duties resulting from Indonesia regulations were to be implemented prior to PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities becoming operational, PT-FI could be required to reduce production levels or be subject to increased costs, which could adversely impact our revenues and operations. There can be no assurance that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in Indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed, or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued, any of which may conflict with PT-FI’s contractual rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Beginning in 2022, the Indonesia government divided the Indonesia portion of the island of New Guinea from two provinces into a total of six provinces, which has resulted in public protest and civil unrest. For further discussion of violence, civil and religious strife, and activism affecting our operations in Indonesia, see the related risk factor below. Further, we cannot predict the impact of splitting provinces on local and regional regulations, permits and other governmental administrative functions, which could have an adverse impact on our business. In 2024, Indonesia held national legislative elections, including the presidential election. Political considerations and administrative changes resulting from these elections or future elections could affect, among other things, national and local policies pertaining to foreign investment, permitting and export restrictions, which could adversely affect our Indonesia operations.",

In accordance with a regulation issued by the Indonesia government in 2023, 30% of PT-FI’s gross export proceeds are being temporarily deposited into Indonesia banks for a period of 90 days before withdrawal. The Indonesia government is considering changes to this regulation, which could increase the amount and length of the requirement, but also allow withdrawals from the balances to fund business requirements. The details of the modifications have not been finalized. PT-FI will not mine all of the ore reserves in the Grasberg minerals district before the initial term of its IUPK expires in 2031. PT-FI’s IUPK may not be extended through 2041 if PT-FI fails to abide by its terms and conditions and applicable laws and regulations. Under the terms of PT-FI’s IUPK, PT-FI has been granted mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041, subject to certain terms and conditions. Refer to Note 11 for a summary of the IUPK’s key fiscal terms. Our proven and probable mineral reserves in Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and PT-FI’s current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041. As a result, PT-FI will not mine all of these mineral reserves during the initial term of the IUPK. Prior to the end of 2031, we expect to mine 40% of aggregate proven and probable recoverable mineral reserves at December 31, 2024, representing 45% of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable copper reserves in Indonesia and 44% of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable gold reserves in Indonesia. If PT-FI does not achieve full ramp-up at the new downstream processing facilities, or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government as set forth in the IUPK, the IUPK may not be extended from 2031 through 2041, and PT-FI would be unable to mine all of its proven and probable mineral reserves in the Grasberg minerals district, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.

Operational risks Our operations are subject to significant operational risks that could adversely affect our business, including the ability to smelt and refine, and our underground mining operations have higher risks than a surface mine. We have assets in a variety of geographic locations, all of which exist in and around broader communities and environments. Maintaining the operational integrity and performance of our assets is crucial to protect our people, the environment and communities in which we operate. Our operations are very large in scale and, by their nature are subject to significant operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. These operational risks, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows, include earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, landslides, wildfires and other natural disasters and extreme weather events; environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals; surface or underground fires; equipment failures; accidents, including in connection with mining equipment, milling equipment or conveyor systems, transportation of chemicals, explosives or other materials and in the transportation of employees and other individuals to and from sites (including where these services are provided by third parties such as vehicle and aircraft transport); wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments; underground water and ore management; lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates; and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form). For a discussion of risks specific to our tailings management, see the risk factors below relating to our management of waste rock and tailings, including our river transport system for tailings management in Indonesia. We are facing continued geotechnical challenges because of the older age of some of our open-pit mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. There can be no assurance that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may not occur, nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures, or that such events will be detected in advance.",

There can be no assurance that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may not occur, nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures, or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as seismic activity or extreme weather, which have in the past and may in the future lead to floods, mudslides, pit-wall instability and possibly even slippage of material, which has and may in the future require suspension of operations and impact operating results. We also experience mining induced seismic activity, including landslides, from time to time in the Grasberg minerals district in addition to extreme weather. The mine site is in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. In addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Indonesia mining operations involve additional risks given their location in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of Indonesia. These conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. The area also receives extreme rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. In February 2023, PT-FI’s operations were temporarily disrupted because of significant rainfall and landslides, which restricted access to infrastructure near its milling operations. We cannot predict whether similar weather-related or seismic events will occur in the future or the extent to which any such event would affect these, or any of our other operations. Underground mining operations have unique risks that can be particularly dangerous, such as those associated with supporting the underground openings. In May 2013, the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility at the Grasberg minerals district collapsed, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries. While we have implemented preventative measures, we cannot guarantee that any incidents will not occur in the future. The occurrence of one or more of these operational risks in connection with our operations may result in the death of, or personal injury or illness to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, significant repair costs, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, extensive community disruption (including short- and long-term health and safety risks), loss of licenses, permits or necessary approvals to operate, loss of workforce confidence, Table of Contents 56 loss of infrastructure and services, disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, any of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.",

Further, the impacts of any serious incidents that occur may also be amplified if we fail to respond timely or in an appropriate manner. In addition, we could also be subject to additional operational risks at our smelters and refineries, including those specific to PT-FI once it is fully dependent on its ability to smelt and refine domestically all its concentrates. Any delay, suspension, loss of access, shutdown of affected facilities or limited availability and capacity related to these smelting and refinery facilities, including equipment or mechanical failures, fires, explosions, unanticipated or extended shutdowns, inability to sell certain by-products, lack of capacity to store certain by-products, extreme weather or natural disasters, social or political unrest or any major public health crisis, any of which may not be recognized as a force majeure event, may significantly impact our ability to export and sell our products, particularly in Indonesia even if alternative refineries or smelters outside of Indonesia are available, and could adversely impact our costs, revenues and results of operations or require us to revise our operating plans, including curtailing or modifying our mining and milling operations. As discussed above and in Note 10, a fire occurred in October 2024 during start-up activities at PT-FI’s new smelter, requiring a temporary suspension of smelting operations to complete repairs. PT-FI expects repairs to be completed by mid-2025 and ramp-up to full capacity to be achieved by year-end 2025. We maintain insurance at amounts we believe to be reasonable to cover some of these risks and hazards; however, our insurance may not sufficiently cover losses from certain of these risks and hazards. There can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be maintained or available at economically feasible premiums, that the proceeds of such insurance will be paid in a timely manner or that we will be adequately compensated for losses actually incurred, if at all.

We may elect not to purchase insurance for certain risks because of the high premium costs associated with insuring such risk or for various other reasons. For example, we do not have coverage for certain environmental losses, including the legal liabilities associated with these risks. The lack of, or insufficiency of, insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flows and overall profitability. Our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business. The waste rock (including overburden) and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of mine waste material. Managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability, geochemistry, water quality and dust generation. Management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to comply with applicable national, state and local laws, permits and approved environmental impact studies. We maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material. Our leaching innovation initiatives include measures that are intended to enhance solution flow through our leach stockpiles, which may increase risks for physical instability of such stockpiles. Tailings impoundments include large embankments that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid structural collapse. Our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions to meet regulatory requirements, which vary depending on location, and to limit potential impacts of dust emissions from our operations on surrounding communities and the environment. Additionally, we must effectively monitor, prevent and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations. In Indonesia, we use a controlled riverine tailings management system, which presents other risks discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to the environmental challenges at our Indonesia mining operations. As of December 31, 2024, we operated 15 active tailings storage facilities (13 in the U.S. and 2 in Peru), of which 10 have an upstream design and 5 have a centerline design. Additionally, we have one centerline tailing storage facility in development. We also manage 29 tailings storage facilities in the U.S. that are inactive or closed (23 with an upstream design, 2 with a centerline design and 4 with a downstream design) and another 25 that are deemed “safely closed” according to the definition in the Tailings Standard (22 with an upstream design and 3 with a centerline design). In 2024, we produced approximately 346 million metric tons of tailings globally.",

In 2024, we produced approximately 346 million metric tons of tailings globally. The failure of tailings storage facilities, other embankments or stockpiles at any of our mining operations could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life, as well as adverse effects on our business and reputation. Some of our tailings storage facilities are located in areas where a failure has the potential to impact individual dwellings, and at least one of our impoundments is in an area where a failure has the potential Table of Contents 57 to impact nearby communities or mining infrastructure. There can be no assurance that a severe or catastrophic failure of any of our facilities will not occur in the future. For additional information regarding the company’s tailings management and stewardship program, including our implementation of the requirements of the Tailings Standard, refer to Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties.” Based on observations from tailings failures at unaffiliated mines and our risk assessment process, which assesses a range of potential risks to our tailings storage facilities, in addition to fatalities and severe personal, property and environmental damages, these events could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, physical failures at sites (such as overtopping of an impoundment), suspension of operations, decrease in mineral reserves, legal liability, government investigations, additional regulations and restrictions on mining operations in response to any such failure, increased monitoring costs and production costs, increased insurance costs or costs associated with insufficiency of or inability to obtain insurance, increased costs and/or limited access to capital, remediation costs, inability to comply with any additional safety requirements or obtain necessary certifications, evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, impacts on occupational health and safety, social risks, and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Our Indonesia mining operations are susceptible to difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in Indonesia environmental laws could increase our costs. Mining operations on the scale of our Indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. Given the unique site-specific topographical, hydrological and geotechnical conditions of the project area, our primary challenge is to dispose of the large volume of tailings we produce. In 2024, PT-FI produced approximately 73 million metric tons of tailings. Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Indonesia government, uses an unnavigable part of a river in the highlands to transport the tailings and natural sediments from the mill in the highlands to an engineered tailings management area in the lowlands.",

Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Indonesia government, uses an unnavigable part of a river in the highlands to transport the tailings and natural sediments from the mill in the highlands to an engineered tailings management area in the lowlands. Levees have been constructed along both sides of the lowlands tailings management area to act as containment structures to laterally contain the depositional footprint of the tailings and natural sediment within the approved tailings management area. Another major environmental challenge at PT-FI is managing overburden stockpiles and other waste rock and conditions in the open pit. Overburden is rock that was previously moved aside in the Grasberg open pit mining process to reach the ore. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some of this material can generate acid rock drainage (acidic water containing dissolved metals) that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment or be costly to manage. There is no guarantee our actions to prevent and manage the quality of any discharge of impacted water will be successful. PT-FI may modify its re-sloping, erosion control and water management plans in the future, which could lead to material increases in costs. In addition, in the past, certain Grasberg overburden stockpiles experienced erosion over time that caused mineralized overburden material to enter into the lowlands tailings management area. This erosion affected the volume as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment material deposited in the lowlands tailings management area, which, if not properly managed, could result in environmental impacts. The underlying overburden erosion and run-off are being managed and controlled through an extensive re-sloping and water management project which is ongoing, and PT-FI has not experienced similar erosion issues since 2018. PT-FI maintains a tailings deposition management plan and environmental monitoring program which consider the presence of this potentially acid-forming overburden in the lowlands tailings management area. PT-FI has expanded the scope of its environmental monitoring program which assesses potential environmental and human health impacts from overburden and tailings. As part of the expanded scope, in 2022 and 2023, PT-FI assisted the Mimika local health authority (LHA) with broad-based community health surveys, which provided further data on an extensive range of community health issues. There were no impacts attributable to PT-FI’s operations (inclusive of tailings and overburden) that were determined to be a priority focus of the LHA following the results of these assessments. In response to the health survey results, PT-FI and the LHA have agreed to collaborate on public health challenges moving forward. During 2024, PT-FI continued its routine assessments of surface waters, groundwaters, sediments and soils, dust and terrestrial and aquatic tissues. In the past, the Indonesia government, stakeholders and other third parties have raised questions with respect to PT-FI’s tailings management systems and plans.",

In the past, the Indonesia government, stakeholders and other third parties have raised questions with respect to PT-FI’s tailings management systems and plans. We continue to revisit studies for alternative tailings management options. Our Indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, which also experiences extreme weather events. Independent environmental management expert audits have reaffirmed conclusions from previous studies that PT-FI’s controlled riverine tailings management Table of Contents 58 system represents the best alternative for tailings management given the volume of tailings produced and the site- specific conditions of the area. Overtopping or failure of any of the PT-FI tailings containment structures (levees or protection structures) induced by extreme weather events such as floods, a major seismic event or naturally occurring weak ground under the structures, are potential risks. The potential impacts from any such occurrence could vary significantly depending upon the specific location of the failure. Unanticipated structural failure of these structures in certain areas in the future could result in flooding of the nearby communities and related loss of lives and/or severe personal, property and environmental damages. Under certain conditions, a failure may necessitate evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, financial assistance to the communities impacted, and remediation costs to repair and compensate for the social, cultural and economic impacts associated with such failure. In addition, in the southern (estuary) portion of the approved tailings management area, mathematical modeling of certain sediment transport scenarios indicates that tailings have the potential to be deposited outside of the approved lateral levees in adjacent mangroves. PT-FI has proposed additional extensions to the existing levees to the Indonesia regulators and is further evaluating the potential benefits and impacts. Indonesia regulators have further proposed a different strategy involving efforts to increase sediment retention through various methods as well as increase beneficial use of tailings. If the additional retention efforts are not successful, or if the permitting for these proposed protection structures is not reconsidered, any such depositional impacts outside of our existing approved footprint could impact the environment and communities. Refer to Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties” for further discussion of our environmental obligations in Indonesia. Managing these environmental challenges at our Indonesia operations could result in reputational harm and increased costs that could be significant. There can be no assurance that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in Indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed, or that new interpretations of existing Indonesia environmental laws and regulations will not be issued, which could have a significant impact on PT-FI.

Violence, civil and religious strife, and activism could result in loss of life and disrupt our operations. Indonesia Indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. Several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of Central Papua, where our Grasberg minerals district is located. In Central Papua, there have been attacks on civilians by separatists and conflicts between separatists and the Indonesia military and police. In addition, illegal miners have clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities. Social, economic and political instability in Central Papua could materially adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our Indonesia operations. Shooting incidents have occurred within the PT-FI project area, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations, which in some instances have involved fatalities or injuries to our employees, contractors, government security personnel and civilians. We incurred no fatalities or injuries relating to shootings within the PT- FI project area since April 2020, and we have had no shootings associated with the PT-FI project area since January 2021. In 2024, based on publicly available reports, we believe that there were more than 60 incidents of separatist violence, resulting in approximately 50 fatalities outside of the PT-FI project area at the Grasberg minerals district but within the province of Central Papua. In one such incident, which did not directly involve or target PT-FI’s operations or workforce, gunfire was exchanged between government security forces and separatists in an area adjacent to the PT-FI project area. Separatist security incidents, including shootings, attacks on civil infrastructure and arson, continue to occur in Central Papua and other areas near the PT-FI project area. PT-FI actively monitors security conditions and the occurrence of incidents both regionally and within the project and support areas. The safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and PT-FI continues to work with the Indonesia government to enhance security and address security-related issues within the PT-FI project area and in nearby areas, including at PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities.

We cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could result in loss of life, or disruption or suspension of PT-FI’s operations. If other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. South America South America countries have historically experienced periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability. In Peru, political uncertainty has created instability in the regulatory environment. Beginning in December 2022 and continuing in 2023, heightened tensions, protests and social unrest emerged in Peru following a change in the country’s political leadership, which temporarily resulted in delays in the transport of supplies, products and people at our Cerro Verde mine. During first-quarter 2023, Cerro Verde also operated at reduced rates from time-to-time until it resumed normal operations in March 2023. Other mining operations in the region temporarily halted mining activities as a result of the civil unrest. While demonstrations and road blockages subsided in 2023, the political situation in Peru remains complex. In addition, the potential for civil unrest, including in relation to mining operations, and disruption of commerce and supply chains continues. Other operations in the region have encountered significant issues with trespassers, illegal miners and civil demonstrations that impact their current operations, expansion projects, logistical supply and product transport. Such protests have occasionally been accompanied by acts of violence and property damage and continue intermittently in the region. In Chile, despite the overwhelming electoral approval of a proposal to rewrite the constitution in a 2020 referendum, the product of the constitutional assembly was rejected by a majority of voters in 2022 and 2023. The political environment remains polarized and political parties are preparing for presidential elections by the end of 2025. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents of civil unrest or political instability will occur in the future in Peru or Chile. Although such civil unrest has not significantly impacted our results, similar events in the future could cause our South America operations to be materially impacted, in which case, we may not be able to meet our production and sales targets.

Our operations, including future expansions or developments, depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies. We recognize that access to clean, safe and reliable water supplies is vital to the health and livelihood of our host communities. Our operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water, and the increasing pressure on water sources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our approach. We aim to balance our operational water requirements with those of the local communities, environment and ecosystems. Most of our North America and South America operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant, and where climate change may lead to increasing scarcity of water sources in the future. Continuous production at our operations and any future expansions or developments are dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. Current and long-term water risks include those that arise from our operations and events that we do not control (such as extreme weather and other physical risks associated with climate change). For further discussion of the potential physical impacts of climate change, see the related risk factor below. As discussed in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings,” in Arizona, where our operations use both surface water and groundwater, we are a participant in an active adjudication in which Arizona courts have been attempting, for 50 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the Gila River watershed, one of the state’s largest river systems. If we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications, our water uses Table of Contents 60 could be diminished or curtailed, and our operations and any future expansions at Morenci, Safford (including Lone Star) and Sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative water sources. Water for our Cerro Verde operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation and from wastewater collected from the city of Arequipa and treated at a wastewater treatment plant constructed by us. Weather patterns have contributed to ongoing drought conditions in the area and water shortages at our Cerro Verde operation are possible, which could impact our operations. Water for our El Abra operation in Chile currently comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer.",

    "text": "Water for our Cerro Verde operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation and from wastewater collected from the city of Arequipa and treated at a wastewater treatment plant constructed by us. Weather patterns have contributed to ongoing drought conditions in the area and water shortages at our Cerro Verde operation are possible, which could impact our operations. Water for our El Abra operation in Chile currently comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer. The agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring through 2029 of the aquifer water levels and select flora species to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping, which if impacted could cause reductions in pumping to restore water levels and could have an adverse effect on production from El Abra. Our permit for pumping of groundwater will expire in 2029 and any renewal or provisional extension may be challenging. We are evaluating water infrastructure alternatives to provide options to extend existing operations and support a future expansion, while continuing to monitor Chile’s regulatory and fiscal matters, as well as trends in capital costs for similar projects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to execute such water infrastructure plans or obtain a new permit or provisional extension, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. For further discussion, see the risk factor above relating to the geopolitical, economic and social risks associated with our operations. Although our operations currently have access to sufficient water sources to support current operational demands, as discussed above, the availability of additional supplies for potential future expansions or development will require additional investments and will take time to develop, if available. While we are taking actions to acquire additional back-up water supplies for current and future mining operations, such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost, or at all. As such, the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures, and the ability to obtain future water supplies could prevent future expansions or developments, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations. We typically have sufficient water for our Indonesia operations, but at times and for reasons out of our control, we may have too much or not enough. The PT-FI project area receives considerable rainfall that makes it susceptible to periodic floods and mudslides, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted. Conversely, the area has experienced, and may in the future experience, certain extended periods without rainfall, which can impact water availability at the milling operations. Our information and operational technology systems have been and in the future may be adversely affected by cybersecurity events, disruptions, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration. Our industry has become increasingly supported by and dependent on digital technologies.",

Our information and operational technology systems have been and in the future may be adversely affected by cybersecurity events, disruptions, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration. Our industry has become increasingly supported by and dependent on digital technologies. Our strategy of operating large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated. Many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations, improve safety and efficiency, and lower costs. As our dependence on information systems, including those of our third-party service providers and vendors, grows, we have become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. In recent years, cybersecurity events have increased in frequency and magnitude and the methods used to gain unauthorized access change frequently, making it increasingly difficult for us to prevent cybersecurity incidents or detect and remediate incidents in a timely and effective manner. Attacks have included and may include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, ransomware, social engineering tactics and credential attacks, insider threats, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access to data and other advanced and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats, including those that increasingly target critical operational technologies and process control networks and those that are increasingly using AI and quantum computing. Such attacks may be perpetrated by a variety of bad actors, some of which may reside in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective. We have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity events in the past and may experience them in the future. In August 2023, we determined that we were subject to a cybersecurity incident that affected certain of our Table of Contents 61 information systems. We performed an investigation of the incident and its associated impact and incurred costs to remediate, which were not material. We cannot guarantee that events of a similar nature, with potentially greater exposure, will not occur in the future. Cybersecurity threats could subject us to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, production downtimes, loss of sales, communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations, unauthorized release of proprietary, commercially sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information, a misappropriation or loss of funds, the corruption of data, significant health and safety consequences, physical destruction of assets, environmental damage, loss of intellectual property, fines, penalties, litigation, regulatory or governmental investigation, liability under or termination of our contracts with third parties, damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, and which in addition could adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.",

We do not maintain cyber risk insurance, and the lack of insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flows and overall profitability in the event of a cybersecurity incident that has a material adverse effect on our business. While cybersecurity events have not had a material impact on us, we can provide no assurance that we will not experience any such impact or additional interruptions to our operations in the future. Given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information and operational technology system disruptions, the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against cybersecurity threats and to mitigate potential risks arising from such threats have not been effective in some instances and may not be sufficient in preventing future cybersecurity incidents. Further, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats. We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information or operational technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. System modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Refer to Item 1C. “Cybersecurity” for further information on our cybersecurity governance, risk management and strategy. Failure to successfully implement or develop new technology systems and increased exposure to risks associated with the use of these systems may adversely affect our business. Information and operational technology systems continue to evolve and, in order to remain competitive, we must implement new technologies in a timely, cost-effective and efficient manner. For example, we may develop and apply AI in decision support systems, material characterization, equipment reliability, mineral extraction and remote/ autonomous operation. We may also pursue strategic alliances, partnership or licensing arrangements with other companies in areas where we believe collaboration can produce technological and industry advancement, which involves special risks that may negatively impact us or our reputation, may not achieve intended objectives, and may not perform as contemplated. We also are advancing a series of initiatives to incorporate new applications, technologies and data analytics to our leaching processes. For additional information on our leaching innovation initiatives, see MD&A. Our failure to successfully implement or develop new technologies, including AI, may adversely affect our competitiveness and, consequently, our results of operations. In addition, we utilize AI and other new technologies in our software, applications and technology platforms to enhance our capabilities in producing copper, improve business processes and respond to threats to our technology platforms.

Actions taken by governmental authorities and third parties to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of any major public health crisis may negatively impact our business, including a disruption of or change to our operating plans. For example, in March 2020, we had to temporarily transition our Cerro Verde mine to care and maintenance status and adjust operations to prioritize critical activities in response to a decree issued by the Peru government relating to COVID-19. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions, or if workplace entry and travel are restricted resulting in the delay of key personnel or external consultants accessing our sites. A major health crisis at any of our operating sites, and particularly at PT-FI’s remote operating site, could disrupt or change our operating plans, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Human capital risks Labor disputes or labor unrest could disrupt our operations. Our business is dependent on maintaining good relations with our workforce. A significant portion of our global employee population is covered by collective labor agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Refer to Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties” for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 28% of our global employee population was covered by collective labor agreements and none of our global employee population was covered by agreements that will expire during 2025. Labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. If we do not successfully negotiate new collective labor agreements with our union employees, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially adversely affected. We have in the past and could in the future experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations. There were no strikes or lockouts at any of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2024. We cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur. Significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.",

Our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain, develop and advance qualified personnel. Our success is dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. Our business depends on our ability to recruit, retain, develop and advance a qualified, inclusive and diverse workforce at all levels, including sufficient personnel to develop, implement and operate new technologies. Our ability to recruit qualified personnel is affected by the available pool of candidates with the training and skills necessary to fill the vacant positions, the impact on the labor supply because of general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages. We continued to face challenges in 2024 with an increasingly competitive and tight labor market, specifically in North America. The tight labor market, hiring more contract workers, and increased competition from other employers in North America continue to represent strategic challenges that are increasing our costs, reducing efficiency, impacting production and our ability to further expand current mining rates and will impact the timing of future developments in North America. If we fail to recruit, retain, develop and advance qualified, inclusive and diverse personnel necessary for the efficient operation of our business Table of Contents 63 or fail to maintain a safe environment, we could continue to face labor challenges, which may result in, but are not limited to, decreased profitability, further decreases to productivity and efficiency, ongoing safety performance challenges, and the further delay of current and potential development projects, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our performance.

Mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. There are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including, but not limited to, unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions and environmental challenges, potential delays (including the ability and timeframe to obtain permits, or because of weather events, social or political unrest or any major public health crisis), cost overruns, availability of economic sources and reliable access to water, power and infrastructure, lower levels of production during ramp-up periods, shortages of materials or labor, construction defects, equipment breakdowns and injuries to persons and property, social acceptance and, in some cases, Indigenous and community consent for potential impacts, partner alignment and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors and although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning, approval and review processes, many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control, which may cause the actual time and capital required to complete a development project and operating costs after completion to exceed our estimates, especially in periods of high inflation. All of our copper and gold production in Indonesia comes from underground mining in the Grasberg minerals district. The development of our underground mines is subject to other unique risks including, but not limited to, underground fires or floods, ventilating harmful gases, fall-of-ground accidents, and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions, which we experience from time to time in the Grasberg minerals district. While we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production, there can be no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays, revised mine plans, injuries to persons and property, or increased capital costs, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

Because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations, our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our long- term success. Depleted mineral reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, reducing operating costs that could extend the life of a mine by allowing us to cost-effectively process ore types that were previously considered uneconomic, investing in and advancing new technologies (such as our leaching innovation initiatives), locating new deposits or acquiring interests in mineral reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties, requires substantial capital expenditures (which may differ significantly from those estimated) and, in some instances, advances in processing technology, and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineral resources since new, large, long-life deposits are increasingly scarce. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably. Even if significant mineral resources are discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. We may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire mineral reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Table of Contents 64 Estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates. Our estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of Subpart 1300 of SEC Regulation S-K. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in mineral estimates. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on assumed long-term prices for the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and molybdenum, and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which may not necessarily be indicative of future results. Our mineral estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to evaluate economic values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Geological assumptions about our mineral resources that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. Estimates of mineral reserves, or the cost at which we anticipate the mineral reserves will be recovered, are based on assumptions, such as metal prices and other economic inputs. Changes to such assumptions may require revisions to mineral reserve estimates which could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results.

Until mineral reserves are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from assumed levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease, or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, there can be no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported mineral reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the term “mineral resources” does not indicate recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as defined by the SEC. Estimates of mineral resources are subject to further exploration and evaluation of development and operating costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors, and, therefore, are subject to considerable uncertainty. Mineral resources do not meet the threshold for mineral reserve modifying factors, such as engineering, legal and/or economic feasibility, that would allow for the conversion to mineral reserves. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimated mineral resources not included in mineral reserves will become recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves. Regulatory, environmental and social risks The costs of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities.

Our operations are subject to extensive and complex environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; protection of endangered and threatened species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. These laws and regulations are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. As a mining company, compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is an integral and costly part of our business. In addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and other approvals to start, continue and expand operations, which could be challenged causing delays or possible denial of necessary permits and other approvals.

As discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to costs incurred for remediating environmental conditions on our properties that are no longer in operation, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and certain of its affiliates. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. In addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. Compliance Table of Contents 65 with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, and other factors. New or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which have resulted and may in the future result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial obligations. Regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase financial responsibility requirements for mine closure and reclamation. Adoption of such environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs, threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities. In addition, there can be no assurance that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development, or constraints on exploration or operations in impacted areas. We have incurred and expect to incur environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners’ shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations. The timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters. For example, revised federal regulations governing hazardous air pollutant emissions at our Miami, Arizona smelter were finalized in May 2024 and are under evaluation.

If inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures. Many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. In addition, new laws and regulations, including executive orders, or changes to or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (Loper Bright) overruled Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (Chevron). Since 1984, Chevron had required courts to give judicial deference to administrative agency actions and reasonable agency interpretations where a statute was silent or ambiguous. In Loper Bright, the Supreme Court held that the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to exercise independent judgment when deciding whether an agency acted within its statutory authority and that courts may not defer to agency interpretations solely because a statute is ambiguous. This decision may result in additional legal challenges to regulations and guidance issued by federal regulatory agencies, including those that impact our industry. Changes under a new president, administration and Congress in the U.S. are also difficult to predict. Any such variations could negatively impact the mining sector, including our business, substantially increase costs to achieve compliance or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information regarding the various regulations affecting us, see Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties.” We incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on or related to properties that have not been operated in many years. FMC and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies, have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the U.S. for more than a century. Activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws generally were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before U.S. industrial companies fully understood the long- term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment. Companies like FMC are now legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment on or from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release into the environment occurred or who caused it.",

Companies like FMC are now legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment on or from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release into the environment occurred or who caused it. That liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners, operators and arrangers, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is, and each arranger may be, held fully responsible Table of Contents 66 for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of our acquisition of FMC, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. We are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have resulted in injury, destruction or loss of natural resources. At December 31, 2024, we had more than 80 active remediation projects in 20 U.S. states. In addition, FMC and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us. Our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon our current knowledge and understanding of: • Complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago; • Assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and • Interpretation of the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates. Significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. The actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material. In addition, remediation standards imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future.",

In addition, remediation standards imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future. Imposition of more stringent remediation standards, particularly for arsenic and lead in soils, poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation. In January 2024, the EPA released guidance lowering the recommended screening levels for investigating lead-contaminated soils and in January 2025, EPA published its final toxicological assessment for inorganic arsenic. This guidance and assessment can be used to establish cleanup levels by some agencies at state and federal remediation sites and may lead to additional regulatory guidance, rulemaking and other regulatory activities. More stringent cleanup levels often lead to higher costs through exponential volume increases due to resulting expanded project footprints. Refer to Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties” and Note 10 for further discussion of our environmental obligations. We face increasing, complex and changing regulatory and stakeholder and other third-party expectations relating to our climate and energy transition plans, which may adversely affect our business. Further, we may not be able to timely or successfully transition from fossil fuel sources for our significant energy needs, which may result in reputational damage. Our operations require significant energy, much of which is currently from fossil fuel sources and is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. Energy represented 16% of our copper mine site operating costs in 2024, and based on currently available information and projected operations, is expected to approximate 16% in 2025. The principal sources of energy consumption at our mining operations are: diesel fuel, which powers mine trucks and other transportation equipment; purchased electricity, which powers core facilities and certain on-site metal processing operations; and coal and natural gas, which provide electricity at certain operations. Existing and proposed governmental conventions, laws, rules, regulations, policies and standards as well as existing and proposed voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks (both in the U.S. and internationally), including those related to climate change, carbon taxes, carbon markets or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, may in the future add significantly to our operating costs, limit or modify our operations, impact the competitiveness of the commodities we produce, and require more resources to comply and remediate in response.

For additional Table of Contents 67 information on climate change conventions, laws, regulations and standards applicable or that may in the future be applicable to FCX or its subsidiaries, refer to Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties.” In response to climate change and societal or stakeholder demands for action, we are advancing 2030 GHG emissions reduction targets and a 2050 net zero aspiration, each of which will result in additional costs to us, the totality of which we cannot currently estimate with accuracy, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve any current or future GHG emissions targets or aspirations. While we strive to transition to more renewable power sources for our mining operations, as a commercial consumer of power, our ability to reduce our GHG emissions associated with our power consumption demand is largely dependent upon the mix of our suppliers and locally available renewable energy resources at our various sites, including our ability to successfully develop renewable energy projects and negotiate power purchase agreements. The transition to renewable and other energy sources could, among other things, increase our capital expenditures, and operating and energy costs, depending on the scope, magnitude and timing of increased regulation of fossil-fuel based energy production, including GHG emissions, as well as the availability of alternative energy sources. In certain aspects of our operations, our ability to reduce our GHG emissions is directly dependent on the actions of third parties and technological solutions and innovation, and our ability to make significant, rapid changes in our GHG emissions in response to potential future regulations may be limited. For example, our diesel-fueled haul trucks are a significant contributor to GHG emissions at our North America and South America operations. We are evaluating options for the electrification of our haul trucks, but reduction of emissions from such haul trucks will depend upon the development and availability of commercially viable alternative-fueled mining equipment by our third-party suppliers. At our remote mining operations in Indonesia, PT-FI owns and operates a coal-fired power plant and continues to advance plans to transition its existing energy source from coal to natural gas. Once complete, PT-FI’s dual-fuel power plant and the new gas-fired combined cycle facility will be fueled by natural gas, supplied by a floating liquefied natural gas storage and regassification unit. Our ability to transition to commercially viable alternative sources of energy across our operations globally will depend on, among other things, additional studies, technological considerations, or permit or other approvals. Even if we do implement new technologies, our stakeholders and other third parties may not be satisfied with our approach to reducing our GHG emissions.",

For further information, see the risk factor below relating to the increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders and other third parties, including creditors, with respect to our environmental and social practices, performance and disclosures. The physical impacts of climate change may adversely affect our mining operations, workforce, communities, biodiversity and ecosystems, supply chains and customers, which may result in increased costs. We recognize that as the climate changes, our operations, workforce, communities, biodiversity and ecosystems, supply chains and customers may be exposed to changes in the frequency, intensity and/or duration of intense storms, drought, flooding (including from sea level rise at our coastal operations), wildfire, and other extreme weather events and patterns (such as extreme heat). For example, we experienced severe flooding, debris flow from heavy rain and landslides in early 2023 at our remote mining operations in Indonesia, which temporarily halted mining and processing work and damaged infrastructure near the milling complex. Such potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. For example, at many of our mine sites, climate change is projected to impact local precipitation regimes, resulting in shorter-duration, higher-intensity storm events, and the potential for less precipitation overall. We could face increased operational costs associated with managing additional volumes of storm water during more intense future events, including supply disruption, delays, damage to or inaccessibility of our facilities and increased pricing of consumables and components we purchase. In addition, the potential for overall decreases in precipitation could affect the availability of water needed for our operations, leading to increased operating costs, or in extreme cases, disruptions to our mining operations. For additional information regarding risks relating to availability of water and operational risks inherent in mining, see related risk factors above.

If we do not meet our stakeholders’ and other third parties’ evolving expectations, including any failure or perceived failure to achieve our stated goals and targets or industry standards or any allegations that our stated goals or targets should be altered, our reputation, competitiveness, access to and cost of capital, business strategy and stock price could be negatively impacted, and legal or regulatory proceedings could be brought against us. Certain investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, investment funds, creditors and other influential investors are focused on our ESG practices and place importance on the ESG implications of their investments and lending decisions. Our ability to attract capital could be adversely impacted if they incorporate more stringent ESG considerations as a part of their portfolios. Organizations that provide information to investors and financial institutions on ESG performance and related matters have developed quantitative and qualitative data collection processes and ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to these matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. In addition, many investors have created their own proprietary ratings that inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ratings or assessment of our ESG practices, including our compliance with certain voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital. Similarly, many financial institutions are increasingly incorporating ESG ratings or assessments into their credit risk assessments, and screen companies based on their ESG practices and performance when making lending decisions. If we are unable to meet the ESG lending criteria set by our creditors or are required to take certain remediation steps to satisfy such criteria, our access to capital on terms we find favorable may be limited and our costs may increase.

Cybersecurity risks are identified and assessed through our ERM program, which is designed to provide cross-functional executive insight across the business to identify and monitor risks, opportunities and emerging trends that can impact our strategic business objectives. The underlying controls of our cyber risk management program are based on recognized best practices and standards for cybersecurity and information technology, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. We utilize dedicated internal and external cybersecurity personnel to focus on assessing, detecting, identifying, managing, preventing and responding to cybersecurity threats and incidents. Our approach to cybersecurity incorporates a layered portfolio of technology controls, including strategic partnerships for our cybersecurity platforms, documented policies and procedures, periodic end user training, including cybersecurity awareness training for employees and certain contractors, and dedicated resources to manage and monitor the evolving threat landscape, including through the gathering of actionable threat intelligence. We maintain and periodically evaluate and, as needed, update our information security policy and an incident response plan, which describes the processes we use to prepare for, detect, respond to and recover from a cybersecurity incident, including processes to assess severity, escalate, contain, investigate and remediate an incident, as well as to comply with potentially applicable legal and disclosure obligations. We regularly evaluate and assess the threat landscape and our security controls, including through audits and assessments, regular network and endpoint monitoring, vulnerability testing, penetration testing and tabletop exercises that include senior management. To assess the design and effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls, we engage with assessors, consultants, auditors and other third parties, including through independent third-party reviews of our information technology security program conducted on at least an annual basis. We also have processes to oversee and identify material cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers, including utilizing safeguards to protect sensitive data, performing diligence on certain third parties that have access to our systems, data or facilities that store such systems or data, continually monitoring cybersecurity threat risks identified through such diligence and contracting to manage cybersecurity risks in specified ways such as requiring agreements to be subject to periodic cybersecurity audits. We have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity incidents in the past, including an incident in August 2023 that affected certain of our information systems and resulted in temporary disruptions to parts of our operations. However, prior cybersecurity incidents, including the August 2023 incident, have not materially affected us.

    "text": "Legal Proceedings. Below is a discussion of pending legal proceedings not otherwise required to be disclosed in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. In addition to the proceedings discussed below and in Note 10, we are involved periodically in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business and not required to be disclosed, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations require us to disclose environmental proceedings involving a governmental authority if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, we use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such environmental proceedings is required. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any currently pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition; although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. Water Rights Adjudications Our operations in the western U.S. require significant secure quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities, and related support facilities. Continuous operation of our mines is dependent on, among other things, our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. In the arid western U.S., where certain of our mines are located, water rights are often contested, and disputes over water rights are generally time-consuming, expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims. The loss of a water right or a currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations, or force premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations. At our North America operations, certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights, which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location. In Arizona, where our operations use both surface and groundwater, we are a participant in an active adjudication in which Arizona courts have been attempting, for 50 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the Gila River system, one of the state’s largest river systems. This Gila River adjudication primarily affects our Morenci, Safford (including Lone Star) and Sierrita mines. The Gila River adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users, including us, as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users.",

The Gila River adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users, including us, as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users. Groundwater is treated differently from surface water under Arizona law, Table of Contents 73 which historically allowed landowners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water, subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use.” However, court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some subsurface water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the Arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and to the adjudication, and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers, including us, in the absence of valid surface water claims. Any re-characterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers, farmers, ranchers, municipalities, and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades. Because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in Arizona, we are an active participant in the Gila River adjudication. In Re The General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Gila River System and Sources, Maricopa County, Superior Court, Cause Nos. W-1 (Salt), W-2 (Verde), W-3 (Upper Gila), and W-4 (San Pedro). This case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the Arizona State Land Department and was consolidated and transferred to the Maricopa County Superior Court in 1981. The principal parties, in addition to us, include: Arizona Public Service Company, ASARCO, LLC; BHP Copper, Inc; the state of Arizona; various cities and towns and water companies; the Gila Valley Irrigation District; the Franklin Irrigation District; the San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District; the Salt River Project; the San Carlos Apache Tribe; the Gila River Indian Community; and the U.S. on behalf of those tribes, on its own behalf, and on behalf of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, the Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and the Payson Community of Yavapai Apache Indians. Prior to January 1, 1983, various Indian tribes filed separate suits in the U.S. District Court in Arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other parties, including us, and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights. These federal proceedings have been stayed in favor of the adjudications pending in Arizona state courts, and some of the federal suits have since been settled.",

These federal proceedings have been stayed in favor of the adjudications pending in Arizona state courts, and some of the federal suits have since been settled. In 2005, the Maricopa County Superior Court directed the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the San Pedro River, a tributary of the Gila River. Subsurface water within the subflow zone is presumed to constitute appropriable subflow rather than groundwater. Although we have minimal interests in the San Pedro River Basin, a decision that re- characterizes groundwater in that basin as appropriable subflow may set a precedent for other river systems in Arizona that could have material implications for many commercial, industrial, municipal and agricultural users of groundwater, including our Arizona operations. In 2017, the court approved ADWR’s proposed subflow zone maps; water pumped from wells located inside the mapped subflow zone is now presumed to be appropriable subflow. No party has appealed that decision. ADWR is now in the process of preparing subflow zone delineations for the applicable watercourses in the Verde River watershed. In December 2021, ADWR issued a report proposing a subflow zone delineation for the Verde River mainstem and Sycamore Creek and objections to that report were submitted in May 2022. While we do not have any active mining operations in the Verde River watershed that would be impacted by this phase of the adjudication, we filed a set of limited objections on issues that could set a precedent for other watersheds in Arizona that could have material implications for many users of groundwater, including our Arizona operations. The Special Master has directed ADWR to submit revised subflow zone delineations consistent with our objections. In 2014, ADWR submitted a proposal for the development of procedures for “cone of depression” analyses to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone. Based on these cone of depression analyses, wells outside of the subflow zone could be subject to the adjudications pending in Arizona state courts. In the absence of a valid surface water claim to support the pumping, owners of wells deemed to be depleting the subflow zone through their cones of depression may be subject to claims that they must refrain from pumping subflow or must pay damages. In January 2017, ADWR issued a report containing its recommended cone of depression test. In November 2018, the Special Master for the Gila River adjudication issued a final decision rejecting ADWR’s recommended cone of depression test, adopting our position that a numeric model capable of accounting for complexities of the aquifer system should be used.",

In November 2018, the Special Master for the Gila River adjudication issued a final decision rejecting ADWR’s recommended cone of depression test, adopting our position that a numeric model capable of accounting for complexities of the aquifer system should be used. However, the Special Master confirmed that the cone of depression test would be the initial test for determining which wells are subject to the adjudications, rather than proving that a well is pumping subflow or establishing how much of a well’s water production is subflow. Such matters will be determined by a subsequent “subflow depletion test,” which is currently under development. While some of our adversaries objected to the Special Master’s final decision, in July 2022, the Arizona Superior Court issued a decision affirming the Special Master’s decision in all respects. No party has appealed that decision. Table of Contents 74 In December 2018, ADWR submitted its initial report on the “subflow depletion test,” noting that the test will specify the methodology a well owner must use to quantify the portion of the water drawn from a well that is subflow as opposed to groundwater. In February 2024, ADWR issued a report setting forth its proposed subflow depletion test, and objections were filed in April 2024. The Special Master ordered ADWR to file an addendum to its report concerning various issues raised in the objections. A status conference is scheduled for February 2025. An issue litigated in the 2018 proceeding concerned whether for the subflow depletion test the subflow zone should be represented in the numeric model as extending only as deep as the bottom of the floodplain alluvium or extend all the way down to bedrock. In August 2021, the Special Master issued an order recognizing our position that if the vertical extent of the subflow zone is extended below the floodplain alluvium, it would result in overstated depletion calculations. Accordingly, the Special Master ordered that the vertical boundary of the subflow zone be restricted to the floodplain alluvium. No party has appealed that decision, and we expect the guidance from the Special Master’s order to be reflected in the subflow depletion test. In proceedings separate from the development of the subflow depletion test, in June 2020, the Special Master designated legal questions to be resolved concerning a well owner’s ability to obtain a surface water right for subsurface water that, while initially believed to be non-appropriable groundwater, is ultimately determined to be appropriable subflow.",

In April 2021, the Special Master ruled that, for uses initiated after enactment of the 1919 permitting statute, a well owner may not pursue a surface water right for subsurface water now unless the well owner filed an application for a permit to appropriate prior to initiating the water use. We, along with allied parties, have objected to the Special Master’s ruling and are awaiting further proceedings before the Arizona Superior Court. Regardless of the outcome in the Arizona Superior Court, we anticipate this issue will be appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court. As part of the adjudications, the U.S. has asserted numerous claims for express and implied “reserved” surface water and groundwater rights on Indian and non-Indian federal lands throughout Arizona. These claims are related to reservations of federal land for specific purposes (e.g., Indian reservations, national parks, military bases and wilderness areas). Unlike state law-based water rights, federal reserved water rights are given priority in the “prior appropriation” system based on the date the land was reserved, not the date that water was first used on the land. In addition, federal reserved water rights may enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state law-based water rights. In multiple instances, the U.S. asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the establishment of the federal reservation. This creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such expansive claims may severely impede competing uses of water within the same watershed. Because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across Arizona, the reserved water right claims of the U.S. pose a significant risk to multiple operations, including Morenci and Safford (including Lone Star) in the Upper Gila River watershed, and Sierrita in the Santa Cruz watershed. Because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations, we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims. Because federal reserved water rights have not yet been quantified, the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the Arizona Superior Court handling the Gila River adjudication. Various “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations in Arizona are currently pending, four of which have been resolved at this time. The first resolved decision was issued in In re Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness Area, which pertained to the U.S.’s claims to water for the Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness Area.",

The first resolved decision was issued in In re Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness Area, which pertained to the U.S.’s claims to water for the Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness Area. The court issued a decision in December 2018 supportive of our position on almost all issues, rejecting the U.S.’s argument that wilderness areas are entitled to all water that was not appropriated at the time the reservation was created. The second resolved decision was issued in In re Redfield Canyon Wilderness Area, which was another case pertaining to claims for a wilderness area. The court issued its decision in August 2022 supportive of our position on almost all issues, denying the U.S.’s federal reserved water rights claims for the wilderness area. The U.S. declined to pursue an interlocutory appeal in either of the In re Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness Area or In re Redfield Canyon Wilderness Area cases. The third resolved decision was issued in In re San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area, which pertained to the U.S.’s claims to water for a national conservation area. The court issued its decision in August 2023 supportive of our position on nearly all issues, rejecting the U.S.’s argument that quantification was based on a more lenient standard than the “minimal need” doctrine, and holding that the U.S. may not obtain a federal reserved right to “optimal” flows to support the riparian and aquatic resources. The court adopted our proposed period of record for quantifying the stream, and therefore adopted our proposed streamflow, and rejected the U.S.’s claims for “streamflow augmentation” and claims to water from various point sources. We anticipate that a decree will be entered in 2025. It is unknown whether the U.S. will pursue an interlocutory appeal. The fourth resolved decision was issued in, In re Fort Table of Contents 75 Huachuca, which involved the U.S.’s claims to water for an Arizona army base. Trial concluded in February 2017. The court issued its decision in September 2024 supportive of our position on almost all issues and entered a decree in December 2024. The result was an approximate 80% reduction of the total acre-feet per year claimed by the U.S. It is unknown whether the U.S. will pursue an interlocutory appeal. In addition, in January 2023, the U.S. filed several federal reserved water rights claims for wilderness areas in portions of the Verde River watershed, as well as a claim for the Verde River pursuant to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, claiming all unappropriated flow within each of the wilderness areas, along with alternative claims to specific stream flows. In reliance on the favorable precedent created in the cases discussed above, we successfully defeated the claims to all unappropriated flow on summary judgment.",

Given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications, their long history, and their long-term legal, economic and political implications, it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings.

The results of operations reported and summarized below include forward-looking statements that are not guarantees of future performance and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results (refer to “Cautionary Statement” below for further discussion). References to “Notes” are Notes included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Throughout MD&A, all references to income or losses per share are on a diluted basis. This section of our Form 10-K discusses the results of operations for the years 2024 and 2023 and comparisons between these years. Discussion of the results of operations for the year 2022 and comparisons between the years 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Items 7. and 7A. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” contained in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. OVERVIEW We are a leading international metals company with the objective of being foremost in copper. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, we operate large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable mineral reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. We are one of the world’s largest publicly traded copper producers. Our portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits; and significant operations in North America and South America, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in Arizona and the Cerro Verde operation in Peru. Our results for 2024 reflect solid execution of our operating plans and we are committed to enhancing productivity, managing costs and capital and advancing opportunities for long-term profitable growth and value creation. We believe the actions we have taken in recent years to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain flexible organic growth options will allow us to continue to execute our business plans, and reliably and responsibly generate cash flows to pursue value-enhancing organic growth options and return cash to shareholders. We believe that we have a high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate long-term value, and we remain focused on executing our operating and investment plans. Our underground mining operations at the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia continue to perform well, with copper production increasing in each of the past three years. During 2024, construction of PT Freeport Indonesia’s (PT-FI) new smelter and precious metals refinery (PMR) (collectively, PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities) in Eastern Java, Indonesia were completed and as part of start-up activities, PT-FI commenced gold production from the PMR in December 2024.",

During 2024, construction of PT Freeport Indonesia’s (PT-FI) new smelter and precious metals refinery (PMR) (collectively, PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities) in Eastern Java, Indonesia were completed and as part of start-up activities, PT-FI commenced gold production from the PMR in December 2024. In October 2024, during start-up activities of the new smelter, a fire occurred requiring a temporary suspension of smelting operations to complete repairs. PT-FI expects repairs to be completed by mid-2025 and ramp-up to full capacity to be achieved by year-end 2025. We are progressing initiatives across our North America and South America operations by incorporating new applications, technologies and data analytics to our leaching processes. Incremental copper production from these initiatives totaled 214 million pounds in 2024, compared with a total of 144 million pounds in 2023. We have projects underway to apply recent operational enhancements to our leaching processes on a larger scale and are testing new innovative technology applications that we believe have the potential for significant increases in recoverable metal from leach stockpiles beyond the current run rate. We believe we benefit from significant copper reserves and resources with embedded growth options, an experienced team and exposure to markets with a favorable fundamental outlook. Net income attributable to common stock totaled $1.9 billion in 2024 and $1.8 billion in 2023. Our results in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily reflect higher average realized copper and gold prices and higher gold sales volumes, partly offset by higher operating costs and higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to higher operating income at PT-FI. Refer to “Consolidated Results” for discussion of items impacting our consolidated results for the two years ended December 31, 2024. Table of Contents 79 At December 31, 2024, we had consolidated debt of $8.9 billion and consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 billion, $4.7 billion including current restricted cash and cash equivalents associated with a portion of PT-FI’s export proceeds required to be temporarily deposited in Indonesia banks. Net debt totaled $1.06 billion, excluding $3.2 billion of debt for PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities. Refer to “Net Debt” for reconciliations of consolidated debt, consolidated cash and cash equivalents and current restricted cash associated with PT-FI's export proceeds to net debt. At December 31, 2024, we had $3.0 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, and PT-FI and Cerro Verde had $1.5 billion and $350 million, respectively, of availability under their revolving credit facilities. In November 2024, we repaid $0.7 billion in scheduled senior note maturities using cash on hand and have no further senior note maturities until 2027.

Refer to Note 6 and “Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further discussion of our debt. We have significant mineral reserves, mineral resources and future development opportunities within our portfolio of mining assets. At December 31, 2024, our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves totaled 97.0 billion pounds of copper, 23.0 million ounces of gold and 3.16 billion pounds of molybdenum. Refer to Note 15 and “Critical Accounting Estimates – Mineral Reserves” for further discussion. During 2024, production from our mines totaled 4.2 billion pounds of copper, 1.9 million ounces of gold and 80 million pounds of molybdenum. Following is the allocation of our consolidated copper, gold and molybdenum production in 2024 by geographic location: Copper Gold Molybdenum North America 29 % 1 % 75 % a South America 28 — 25 Indonesia 43 99 — 100 % 100 % 100 % a. Our North America copper mines produced 38% of consolidated molybdenum production, and our Henderson and Climax molybdenum mines produced 37%. Copper production from three of our mines (the Morenci mine in North America, the Cerro Verde mine in Peru and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia) together totaled 77% of our consolidated copper production in 2024. OUTLOOK Our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in market prices primarily for copper, gold and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum, as well as other factors. World market prices for these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Refer to “Markets,” and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further discussion. Because we cannot control the prices of our products, the key measures that management focuses on in operating our business are sales volumes, unit net cash costs, operating cash flows and capital expenditures. The forward-looking statements in the below section and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K are based on current market conditions, speak only as of the filing date of this annual report on Form 10-K, are based on several assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to “Cautionary Statement” below.

Includes 53 million pounds from our North America and South America copper mines and 35 million pounds from our Molybdenum mines. Projected sales volumes are dependent on operational performance; Indonesia regulatory approval to export copper concentrate until repairs and full ramp-up of PT-FI’s new smelter are complete; weather-related conditions; timing of shipments and other factors. For further discussion of other important factors that could cause results to differ materially from projections, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Consolidated Unit Net Cash Costs Consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our copper mines are expected to average $1.60 per pound of copper for the year 2025, based on achievement of current sales volume estimates (including estimates for copper concentrate exports from Indonesia) and cost estimates and assuming average prices of $2,700 per ounce of gold and $20.00 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2025. Quarterly unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes, including the ratio of copper and gold sales within a period, and realized prices, primarily for gold and molybdenum. The impact of price changes on consolidated unit net cash costs for the year 2025 would approximate $0.04 per pound of copper for each $100 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $0.03 per pound of copper for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. Consolidated Operating Cash Flows Our consolidated operating cash flows vary with sales volumes; prices realized from copper, gold and molybdenum sales; production costs; income taxes; other working capital changes; and other factors. Our consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to approximate $6.2 billion for the year 2025, based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average prices of $4.00 per pound of copper, $2,700 per ounce of gold and $20.00 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2025. Estimated consolidated operating cash flows in 2025 also reflect a projected income tax provision of $2.6 billion (refer to “Consolidated Results – Income Taxes” for further discussion of our projected income tax rate). The impact of price changes on operating cash flows for the year 2025 would approximate $375 million for each $0.10 per pound change in the average price of copper, $140 million for each $100 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $135 million for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.",

Includes $1.1 billion for planned projects, primarily associated with underground mine development, supporting mill and power capital costs and a portion of spending on a new gas-fired combined cycle facility in the Grasberg minerals district, and expansion projects in North America, and $1.7 billion for discretionary growth projects, primarily in the Grasberg minerals district for the development of Kucing Liar and at the Bagdad mine for tailings infrastructure. b. Excludes capitalized interest, commissioning and owner’s costs. Capital expenditures for PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities are expected to be funded with PT-FI’s cash flows from operations and availability under PT-FI’s revolving credit facility. We closely monitor market conditions and will adjust our operating plans, including capital expenditures, to protect our liquidity and preserve our asset values, as necessary. MARKETS Prices for copper, gold and molybdenum are affected by numerous factors beyond our control and can fluctuate significantly (for further discussion refer to “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024).

We base these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances; however, reported results could differ from those based on the current estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The areas requiring the use of management’s estimates are also discussed in Note 1 under the subheading “Use of Estimates.” Management has reviewed the following discussion of its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (Board). Income Taxes Refer to Note 9, and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further discussion of our consolidated income taxes. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate the actual amount of income taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in income in the period in which such changes are enacted. Income taxes represent a critical accounting estimate as our operations are in multiple tax jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. We and our subsidiaries are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of our contracts or laws. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. We use significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred income tax assets for which available information, including positive and negative evidence, suggests that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider carryback opportunities, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction, as well as future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences.",

In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider carryback opportunities, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction, as well as future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred income tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion of our valuation allowances. On January 1, 2023, the provisions of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Act) became applicable to us. The Act includes, among other provisions, a new Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average annual AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. In September 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued proposed regulations that provide guidance on the application of the CAMT, which are not final and subject to change. Based on the proposed guidance released by the IRS, we determined that the provisions of the Act did not impact our financial results for the years 2024 or 2023. In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a framework for Pillar Two of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules, which was designed to coordinate participating jurisdictions in updating the international tax system to ensure that large multinational companies pay a minimum level of income Table of Contents 84 tax. Recommendations from the OECD regarding a global minimum income tax and other changes are being considered and/or implemented in jurisdictions where we operate. At current metals market prices, we do not expect enactment of the recommended framework in jurisdictions where we operate to materially impact our financial results. We have uncertain tax positions related to income tax assessments in Peru and Indonesia, including penalties and interest, which have not been recorded at December 31, 2024. Final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, we pay a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is collectible.

Environmental Obligations Refer to Notes 1 and 10, and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further discussion of environmental obligations, including a summary of changes in our estimated environmental obligations for the three years ended December 31, 2024. Our current and historical operating activities are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, and compliance with these laws and regulations requires significant expenditures. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. The guidance provided by U.S. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred, and the cost can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2024, environmental obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet totaled $2.0 billion, which reflect obligations for environmental liabilities attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters. Accounting for environmental obligations represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) changes to environmental laws and regulations and/or circumstances affecting our operations could result in significant changes to our estimates, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations, (ii) we will not incur most of these costs for a number of years, requiring us to make estimates over a long period, (iii) calculating the discounted cash flows for certain of our environmental obligations requires management to estimate the amounts and timing of projected cash flows and make long-term assumptions about inflation rates and (iv) changes in estimates used in determining our environmental obligations could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Asset Retirement Obligations Refer to Notes 1 and 10, and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further discussion of reclamation and closure costs, including a summary of changes in our asset retirement obligations (AROs) for the three years ended December 31, 2024. We record the fair value of our estimated AROs associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. Fair value is measured as the present value of cash flow estimates after considering inflation and a market risk premium. Our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. These cost estimates may differ from financial assurance cost estimates for reclamation activities because of a variety of factors, including obtaining updated cost estimates for reclamation activities, the timing of reclamation activities, changes in scope and the exclusion of certain costs not Table of Contents 85 considered reclamation and closure costs. At December 31, 2024, AROs recorded in our consolidated balance sheet totaled $3.7 billion. Generally, ARO activities are specified by regulations or in permits issued by the relevant governing authority, and management’s judgment is required to estimate the extent and timing of expenditures. Accounting for AROs represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) we will not incur most of these costs for a number of years, requiring us to make estimates over a long period, (ii) reclamation and closure laws and regulations could change in the future, we may commit to taking additional closure actions and/or circumstances affecting our operations could change, (iii) the methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores, remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines, and restore the wellsite could change, (iv) calculating the fair value of our AROs requires management to estimate projected cash flows, make long-term assumptions about inflation rates, determine our credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates and determine market risk premiums that are appropriate for our operations and (v) given the magnitude of our estimated reclamation, mine closure and wellsite abandonment and restoration costs, changes in any or all of these estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves were determined from the application of relevant modifying factors to geological data, in order to establish an operational, economically viable mine plan, and have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of Subpart 1300 of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K. The determination of mineral reserves represents a critical accounting estimate because it involves numerous uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of the ore bodies, including quantities, grades and recoveries. Estimating the quantity and grade of mineral reserves requires us to determine the size, shape and depth of our ore bodies by analyzing geological data, such as samplings of drill holes, tunnels and other underground workings. In addition to the geology of our mines, assumptions are required to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves, including estimates of future commodity prices, the mining methods we use and the related costs incurred to develop and mine our mineral reserves. Our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees. These estimates are reviewed and verified regularly by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve determination. Our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2024, were determined using metal price assumptions of $3.25 per pound of copper, $1,600 per ounce of gold and $12.00 per pound of molybdenum. The following table summarizes changes in our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves during 2024: Copper (billion pounds) Gold (million ounces) Molybdenum (billion pounds) Reserves at December 31, 2023a 104.1 24.5 3.34 Net revisions (3.0) b 0.4 (0.10) Production (4.2) (1.9) (0.08) Reserves at December 31, 2024a,c 97.0 23.0 3.16 a. Includes estimated recoverable metals contained in stockpiles. See below for additional discussion of recoverable copper in stockpiles. b. Revisions are primarily the result of higher cost assumptions and updated geologic models. c. May not foot because of rounding. As discussed in Note 1, we depreciate our life-of-mine mining and milling assets and values assigned to proven and probable mineral reserves using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves. Because the economic assumptions used to estimate mineral reserves may change from period to period and additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of mineral reserves may change, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations, including changes to prospective depreciation rates and impairments of long-lived asset carrying values.",

Based on projected copper sales volumes, if estimated copper reserves at our mines were 10% higher at December 31, 2024, we estimate that our annual depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense for 2025 would decrease by approximately Table of Contents 86 $110 million (approximately $43 million to net income attributable to common stock), and a 10% decrease in copper reserves would increase DD&A expense by approximately $137 million (approximately $53 million to net income attributable to common stock). We perform annual assessments of our existing assets in connection with the review of mine operating and development plans. If it is determined that assigned asset lives do not reflect the expected remaining period of benefit, any change could affect prospective DD&A rates. As discussed below, we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, and changes to our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability. Recoverable Copper in Stockpiles Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of our accounting policy for recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles, including adjustments to stockpile inventory volumes and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for risks associated with implementation of new technologies associated with the recovery of copper in leach stockpiles. We record, as inventory, applicable costs for copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles that are expected to be processed in the future based on proven processing technologies. Mill and leach stockpiles are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. Accounting for recoverable copper from mill and leach stockpiles represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, thus requiring management to employ reasonable estimation methods and (ii) recoveries from leach stockpiles can vary significantly. At December 31, 2024, estimated consolidated recoverable copper was 1.4 billion pounds in leach stockpiles (with a carrying value of $2.2 billion) and 0.3 billion pounds in mill stockpiles (with a carrying value of $0.4 billion).

Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets Refer to Note 1, and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further information regarding, and risks associated with, impairment of long-lived mining assets. We assess the carrying values of our long-lived mining assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating our long-lived mining assets for recoverability, we use estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of our mines. Estimates of future cash flows are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term metal price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the mineral reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. We believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for our individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows. During the two-year period ended December 31, 2024, no material impairments of our long-lived mining assets were recorded. In addition to decreases in future metal price assumptions, other events that could result in future impairment of our long-lived mining assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site production levels or costs.

Following is a summary of changes in our consolidated revenues from 2023 to 2024 (in millions): Consolidated revenues – 2023 $ 22,855 Mining operations: (Lower) higher sales volumes: Copper (73) Gold 316 Molybdenum (63) Higher (lower) averaged realized prices: Copper 1,464 Gold 836 Molybdenum (225) Adjustments for prior year provisionally priced copper sales (155) Higher Atlantic Copper revenues 207 Higher revenues from sales of purchased copper 277 Lower treatment charges 142 Higher export duties and royalties (246) Other, including intercompany eliminations 120 Consolidated revenues – 2024 $ 25,455 Sales Volumes. Copper sales volumes in 2024 were slightly lower than 2023, primarily reflecting lower ore grades and operating rates in North America, partly offset by higher ore grades and operating rates in Indonesia. Gold sales volumes were higher in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily reflecting the timing of shipments at PT-FI. Refer to “Operations” for further discussion of sales volumes at our mining operations. Realized Prices. Our consolidated revenues can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum. In 2024, our average realized prices, compared with 2023, were 9% higher for copper, 23% higher for gold and 12% lower for molybdenum. Certain sales contracts for copper and gold provide final pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date).",

In 2024, our average realized prices, compared with 2023, were 9% higher for copper, 23% higher for gold and 12% lower for molybdenum. Certain sales contracts for copper and gold provide final pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date). We record revenues and invoice customers at the time of shipment based on then- current LME or London PM prices, which results in an embedded derivative on provisionally priced sales that are adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until final pricing on the date of settlement. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising copper and gold prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper and gold prices, the opposite occurs. Consolidated revenues include net favorable (unfavorable) adjustments to current year provisionally priced copper sales (i.e., provisionally priced sales during the years 2024 and 2023) totaling $89 million for 2024 and $(86) million for 2023. See below for discussion of adjustments related to prior year provisionally priced copper sales. Prior Year Provisionally Priced Copper Sales. Net favorable adjustments to prior years’ provisionally priced copper sales (i.e., provisionally priced copper sales at December 31, 2023 and 2022) recorded in consolidated revenues totaled $28 million in 2024 and $183 million in 2023. Refer to “Disclosures About Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk” for further discussion of our provisionally priced copper sales, and to Note 12 for a summary of total adjustments to prior period and current period provisionally priced copper sales. Atlantic Copper Revenues. Higher Atlantic Copper revenues of $3.0 billion in 2024, compared with $2.8 billion in 2023, primarily reflects higher copper prices. Table of Contents 89 Sales of Purchased Copper. We purchase copper cathode primarily for processing by our Rod & Refining operations. The volumes of copper purchases vary depending on cathode production from our operations and totaled 158 million pounds in 2024 and 103 million pounds in 2023. Revenues associated with the sale of purchased copper vary with the volume of copper purchases and changes in copper prices. Treatment Charges. Revenues from our concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment charges (i.e., fees paid to smelters that are generally negotiated annually), which will vary with the sales volumes and the price of copper. The decrease in treatment charges in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily reflects lower copper concentrate sales volumes in South America. Export Duties and Royalties. Export duties and royalties are primarily associated with PT-FI sales.",

    "text": "The decrease in treatment charges in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily reflects lower copper concentrate sales volumes in South America. Export Duties and Royalties. Export duties and royalties are primarily associated with PT-FI sales. Effective March 29, 2023, PT-FI’s export duties of 2.5% were eliminated upon verification that construction progress of its new smelter exceeded 50%, but were reinstated at a rate of 7.5% in July 2023 under a revised regulation. PT-FI incurred export duties totaling $457 million in 2024 and $324 million in 2023. Royalties will vary with the volume of metal sold and the prices of copper and gold. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of PT-FI’s export duties and royalties. Production and Delivery Costs Consolidated production and delivery costs totaled $15.6 billion in 2024, compared with $13.6 billion in 2023. Higher production and delivery costs in 2024 primarily reflect increased costs at PT-FI associated with higher operating rates and sales volumes, and for adjustments to its ARO (refer to Note 10 for discussion of Indonesia reclamation and closure programs). Production and delivery costs also includes oil and gas charges totaling $217 million in 2024 and $70 million in 2023, mostly for impairments and assumed abandonment obligations from bankruptcies of other companies (refer to Note 10) and nonrecurring labor-related charges totaling $97 million in 2024 associated with Cerro Verde’s new collective labor agreements (CLA). Refer to Note 14 for details of production and delivery costs by operating segment. Mining Unit Site Production and Delivery Costs Per Pound. Site production and delivery costs for our copper mining operations primarily include labor, energy and other commodity-based inputs, such as sulfuric acid, steel, reagents, liners, tires and explosives. Consolidated unit site production and delivery costs (before net noncash and other costs) for our copper mines averaged $2.49 per pound of copper in 2024 and $2.36 per pound in 2023. Refer to “Operations – Unit Net Cash Costs” for further discussion of unit net cash costs associated with our operating divisions, and to “Product Revenues and Production Costs” for reconciliations of per pound costs by operating division to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements. Our copper mining operations require significant amounts of energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. Our take-or-pay contractual obligations for electricity totaled approximately $0.2 billion at December 31, 2024. We do not have take-or-pay contractual obligations for other energy commodities. Energy represented 16% of our copper mine site operating costs in 2024, including purchases of approximately 270 million gallons of diesel fuel; approximately 8,550 gigawatt hours of electricity at our North America and South America copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our Indonesia mining operation); approximately 750 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in Indonesia; and approximately 2 million MMBtu (million British thermal units) of natural gas at certain of our North America mines.",

Based on current cost estimates, energy will approximate 16% of our copper mine site operating costs for the year 2025. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Depreciation will vary under the UOP method as a result of changes in sales volumes and the related UOP rates at our mining operations. Consolidated DD&A totaled $2.2 billion in 2024 and $2.1 billion in 2023. Our consolidated DD&A is estimated to approximate $2.5 billion for the year 2025, based on current sales volume estimates. The increase in 2025, compared to 2024, primarily reflects expected completion of commissioning activities for PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities. Environmental Obligations and Shutdown Costs Environmental obligation costs reflect net revisions to our long-term environmental obligations, which vary from period to period because of changes to environmental laws and regulations, the settlement of environmental matters and/or circumstances affecting our operations that could result in significant changes in our estimates (refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates – Environmental Obligations” for further discussion). Shutdown costs include care- and-maintenance costs and any litigation, remediation or related expenditures associated with closed facilities or operations. Table of Contents 90 Net charges for environmental obligations and shutdown costs totaled $127 million in 2024, including $82 million in net adjustments to environmental obligations. Net charges totaled $319 million in 2023, including $195 million in net adjustments to environmental obligations and $65 million associated with an adjustment to the proposed settlement of talc-related litigation. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion of environmental obligations and litigation matters. Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest costs (before capitalization) totaled $710 million in 2024 and $782 million in 2023. The year 2023 included $74 million of interest charges associated with Cerro Verde’s contested tax rulings issued by the Peru Supreme Court. Capitalized interest totaled $391 million in 2024 and $267 million in 2023. The increase in capitalized interest in 2024, compared with 2023, resulted from construction and development projects in process, primarily related to PT- FI’s new downstream processing facilities. Refer to “Operations” and “Capital Resources and Liquidity – Investing Activities” for further discussion of current development projects. Other Income, Net Other income, net, which totaled $362 million in 2024 and $286 million in 2023, primarily includes amounts associated with interest income, currency exchange gains and losses, and mark-to-market impacts of trust assets used to satisfy financial assurance obligations for our New Mexico mining operations.",

Table of Contents 91 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Refer to Note 2 for ownership in our subsidiaries. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which is primarily associated with PT-FI, Cerro Verde and El Abra, totaled $2.5 billion in 2024 and $1.9 billion in 2023. In September 2024, we increased our ownership interest in Cerro Verde to 55.08% from 53.56%. Refer to Note 14 for net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for each of our business segments. Based on achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of $4.00 per pound of copper, $2,700 per ounce of gold and $20.00 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2025, we estimate that net income attributable to noncontrolling interests will approximate $2.3 billion for the year 2025. The impact of price changes on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year 2025 would approximate $0.2 billion for each $0.25 per pound change in the average price of copper for the year 2025. The actual amount will depend on many factors, including relative performance of each business segment, commodity prices, costs and other factors. OPERATIONS Responsible Production Refer to Items 1. and 2. “Business and Properties” and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for discussion of our involvement with the International Council on Mining & Metals and environmental (including climate) and social-related risks. We demonstrate our responsible production performance through the Copper Mark, a comprehensive assurance framework developed specifically for the copper industry, and recently extended to other metals including molybdenum. To achieve the Copper Mark, each site is required to complete an independent external assurance process to assess conformance with various environmental, social and governance criteria. Awarded sites must be revalidated every three years. We have achieved, and are committed to maintaining, the Copper Mark and/or Molybdenum Mark, as applicable, at all of our operating sites globally. Technology and Leaching Innovation Initiatives We are progressing initiatives across our North America and South America operations by incorporating new applications, technologies and data analytics to our leaching processes. In late 2023, we achieved our initial incremental annual run rate target of approximately 200 million pounds of copper. Incremental copper production from these initiatives totaled 214 million pounds in 2024, compared with a total of 144 million pounds in 2023.",

Incremental copper production from these initiatives totaled 214 million pounds in 2024, compared with a total of 144 million pounds in 2023. We have projects underway to apply recent operational enhancements to our leaching processes on a larger scale and are testing new innovative technology applications that we believe have the potential for significant increases in recoverable metal from leach stockpiles beyond the current run rate. Continued success with these initiatives could contribute to favorable adjustments in recoverable copper in certain leach stockpiles and positively impact average unit net cash costs. In addition to technology-driven leaching initiatives, we are pursuing opportunities to leverage new technologies and analytic tools in automation and operating practices with a goal of improving operating efficiencies, and reducing costs and capital intensity of our current operations and future development projects. We believe these technology and leaching initiatives are particularly important to our North America operations, which have lower ore grades. Feasibility and Optimization Studies We are engaged in various studies associated with potential future expansion projects primarily at our mining operations. The costs for these studies are charged to production and delivery costs as incurred and totaled $155 million in 2024 and $185 million in 2023. We estimate the costs of these studies will approximate $240 million for the year 2025, subject to market conditions and other factors. Table of Contents 92 North America We manage seven copper operations in North America – Morenci, Bagdad, Safford (including Lone Star), Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. We also operate a copper smelter in Miami, Arizona. All of the North America operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci. We record our 72% undivided joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method. The North America copper operations include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and solution extraction/electrowinning (SX/EW) facilities. A majority of the copper produced at our North America copper operations is cast into copper rod by our Rod & Refining segment. The remainder of our North America copper production is sold as copper cathode or copper concentrate, a portion of which is shipped to Atlantic Copper (our wholly owned smelter and refinery in Spain). Molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver are also produced by certain of our North America copper operations. Development Activities. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further discussion of risks associated with development projects. We have substantial reserves and future opportunities in the U.S., primarily associated with existing mining operations. We have a potential expansion project to more than double the concentrator capacity of the Bagdad operation in northwest Arizona. Bagdad’s reserve life currently exceeds 80 years and supports an expanded operation.",

We have a potential expansion project to more than double the concentrator capacity of the Bagdad operation in northwest Arizona. Bagdad’s reserve life currently exceeds 80 years and supports an expanded operation. In late 2023, we completed technical and economic studies, which indicate the opportunity to construct new concentrating facilities to increase copper production by 200 to 250 million pounds per year at estimated incremental project capital costs of approximately $3.5 billion. Expanded operations would provide improved efficiency and reduce unit net cash costs through economies of scale. Project economics indicate that the expansion would require an incentive copper price in the range of $3.50 to $4.00 per pound and approximately three to four years to complete. The decision of whether to proceed and timing of the potential expansion will take into account overall copper market conditions, availability of labor and other factors, including deployment of our autonomous haul truck fleet conversion expected by year-end 2025 and expanding housing alternatives to support long-range plans. In parallel, we are enhancing local infrastructure and advancing activities for expanded tailings infrastructure projects required under long-range plans in order to advance the potential construction timeline. We have commenced pre-feasibility studies in the Lone Star district of Safford to define a potential significant expansion opportunity. Positive drilling conducted in recent years indicates a large, mineralized district with opportunities to pursue a further expansion project. We expect to complete these studies in 2026. The decision of whether to proceed and timing of the potential expansion will take into account results of technical and economic studies, overall copper market conditions and other factors.

Our North America copper mines have varying cost structures because of differences in ore grades and characteristics, processing costs, by-product credits and other factors. Average unit net cash costs (net of by- product credits) for the North America copper mines of $3.11 per pound of copper in 2024 were higher than average unit net cash costs of $2.63 per pound of copper in 2023, primarily reflecting lower copper volumes and higher mining and labor costs. Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, North America’s average unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales. Revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. Refer to “Consolidated Results – Revenues” for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales. Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines are expected to approximate $3.00 per pound of copper for the year 2025, based on achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average price of $20.00 per pound of molybdenum. North America’s average unit net cash costs for the year 2025 would change by approximately $0.05 per pound for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. South America We manage two copper operations in South America – Cerro Verde in Peru (in which we own a 55.08% interest) and El Abra in Chile (in which we own a 51% interest), which are consolidated in our financial statements. In September 2024, we purchased 5.3 million shares of Cerro Verde common stock for $210 million, increasing our ownership interest in Cerro Verde to 55.08% from 53.56%. South America operations includes open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW facilities. Production from our South America operations is sold as copper concentrate or cathode under long-term contracts. Table of Contents 95 Our South America operations also sell a portion of their copper concentrate production to Atlantic Copper. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. Development Activities. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further discussion of risks associated with development projects. At the El Abra operations in Chile, we have completed substantial drilling and evaluations to define a large sulfide resource that would support a potential major mill project similar to the large-scale concentrator at Cerro Verde. We are preparing data for a potential submission of an environmental impact statement by year-end 2025, subject to ongoing stakeholder engagement and economic evaluations. Preliminary estimates, which remain under review, indicate that the project economics would be supported using an incentive copper price of less than $4.00 per pound.",

Refer to “Consolidated Results” for our consolidated molybdenum sales volumes, which include sales of molybdenum produced at Cerro Verde. Our consolidated copper production and sales volumes from our South America operations in 2024 were slightly lower than 2023 volumes, primarily reflecting lower operating rates, offset by higher ore grades. South America copper sales volumes are expected to approximate 1.1 billion in 2025 as a result of slightly lower expected ore grades. Refer to “Outlook” for projected molybdenum sales volumes. Unit Net Cash Costs. We believe unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure that provides investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Indonesia PT-FI operates one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines at the Grasberg minerals district in Central Papua, Indonesia. PT-FI produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. We have a 48.76% ownership interest in PT-FI and manage its operations. PT-FI's results are consolidated in our financial statements. Once the full ramp-up of the new downstream processing facilities is achieved, PT-FI will be a fully integrated producer of refined copper and gold. Concentrate Exports. Current regulations in Indonesia prohibit exports of copper concentrate as of January 1, 2025. Pursuant to the terms of its special mining business license (IUPK) regarding force majeure events, PT-FI has requested approval from the Indonesia government to permit the export of copper concentrate in 2025 until the Table of Contents 97 required repairs of its new smelter following the October 2024 fire incident (see below for further discussion) and full ramp-up are complete. Based on discussions with the Indonesia government, PT-FI expects to re-commence exports of copper concentrate during first-quarter 2025, and pursuant to current regulations, would be required to pay a 7.5% export duty on copper concentrate exports during 2025. Refer to Notes 10 and 11 for further discussion of Indonesia regulatory matters, including its IUPK, export proceeds and export duties. Long-Term Mining Rights. Pursuant to regulations issued during 2024, PT-FI is eligible to apply for an extension of its mining rights beyond 2041, provided certain conditions are met, including ownership of integrated downstream facilities that have entered the operational stage; domestic ownership of at least 51% and agreement with a state- owned enterprise for an additional 10% ownership; and commitments for additional exploration and increases in refining capacity, each as approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Application for extension may be submitted at any time up to one year prior to the expiration of PT-FI’s IUPK. PT-FI expects to apply for an extension during 2025, pending agreement with MIND ID on a purchase and sale agreement for the transfer in 2041 of an additional 10% interest in PT-FI. An extension would enable continuity of large-scale operations for the benefit of all stakeholders and provide growth options through additional resource development opportunities in the highly attractive Grasberg minerals district.

Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further discussion of risks associated with development projects. Over a multi-year investment period, PT-FI has successfully commissioned three large-scale underground mines in the Grasberg minerals district (Grasberg Block Cave, Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) and Big Gossan). Milling rates for ore from these underground mines averaged 208,400 metric tons of ore per day in 2024 and 198,300 metric tons of ore per day in 2023. In December 2024, PT-FI completed construction of a new copper cleaner circuit, a mill recovery project to enhance recoveries and optimize concentrate production, with commissioning underway. Kucing Liar. Long-term mine development activities are ongoing for PT-FI’s Kucing Liar deposit in the Grasberg minerals district. Kucing Liar is expected to produce over 7 billion pounds of copper and 6 million ounces of gold between 2029 and the end of 2041, and an extension of PT-FI’s operating rights beyond 2041 would extend the life of the project. Development activities commenced in 2022 and are expected to continue over an approximate 10- year timeframe. Capital investments for Kucing Liar are estimated to total $4 billion over the next seven to eight years (averaging approximately $0.5 billion per annum). Approximately $0.6 billion has been incurred through December 31, 2024. At full operating rates, annual production from Kucing Liar is expected to approximate 560 million pounds of copper and 520 thousand ounces of gold, providing PT-FI with sustained long-term, large-scale and low-cost production. Kucing Liar will benefit from substantial shared infrastructure and PT-FI’s experience and long-term success in block-cave mining. Natural Gas Facilities. PT-FI plans to transition its existing energy source from coal to natural gas, which would meaningfully reduce PT-FI’s Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions at the Grasberg minerals district. The majority of PT-FI’s planned investments in a new gas-fired combined cycle facility are expected to be incurred over the next three years, at a cost of approximately $1 billion, which represents an incremental cost of $0.4 billion compared to previously planned investments to refurbish the existing coal units. Once complete, PT-FI’s dual-fuel power plant and the new gas-fired combined cycle facility will be fueled by natural gas, supplied by a floating liquefied natural gas storage and regassification unit. Downstream Processing Facilities. New Smelter. Construction of the new greenfield smelter in Eastern Java, Indonesia was completed during 2024. In October 2024, during start-up activities, a fire occurred that required a temporary suspension of smelting operations to complete repairs. Procurement of long-lead items is advanced and repairs are scheduled to be completed by mid-2025, and PT-FI expects ramp-up to full capacity to be achieved by year-end 2025. PT-FI expects restoration, repair and replacement costs to approximate $100 million, which are expected to be mostly offset through recovery under construction insurance programs.

PT-FI’s consolidated copper production volumes for 2024 exceeded sales volumes, reflecting an increase in concentrate inventory held at PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities expected to be sold as refined metal in the second half of 2025. PT-FI’s consolidated copper and gold production volumes for 2023 exceeded sales volumes, reflecting the deferral of sales recognition related to the PT Smelting tolling arrangement (as discussed below and in Note 2). Consolidated sales volumes from PT-FI are expected to approximate 1.55 billion pounds of copper and 1.6 million ounces of gold in 2025. PT-FI’s projected sales volumes in 2025 reflect reduced operating rates associated with two major maintenance projects in its concentrating facilities. Projected sales volumes are dependent on operational performance; Indonesia regulatory approval to export copper concentrate until repairs and full ramp-up of PT-FI’s new smelter are complete; weather-related conditions; and other factors detailed in the “Cautionary Statement” below.

PT-FI’s unit net cash credits (including gold, silver and other by-product credits) of $0.28 per pound of copper in 2024 was favorable compared to the unit net cash costs (net of gold, silver and other by-product credits) of $0.10 per pound of copper in 2023, primarily reflecting higher gold credits and higher copper volumes. Treatment charges vary with the volume of metals sold and the price of copper, and royalties vary with the volume of metals sold and the prices of copper and gold. PT-FI royalties totaled $433 million in 2024 and $338 million in 2023. Export duties totaled $457 million in 2024 and $324 million in 2023. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of PT-FI’s export duties. Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, PT-FI’s unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper volumes and changes in copper and gold inventory. Revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. Refer to “Consolidated Results – Revenues” for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales. As discussed in Note 2, beginning in 2023, PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting changed from a copper concentrate sales agreement to a tolling arrangement and there are no further sales from PT-FI to PT Smelting. PT Smelting’s intercompany profit for 2023 represents the change in the deferral of PT-FI’s profit on prior sales to PT Smelting. Table of Contents 100 Average unit net cash credits (including gold, silver and other by-product credits) for PT-FI are expected to approximate $0.27 per pound of copper for the year 2025, based on achievement of current sales volumes (including estimates for copper concentrate exports) and cost estimates and assuming an average price of $2,700 per ounce of gold. PT-FI’s average unit net cash costs for the year 2025 would change by approximately $0.09 per pound of copper for each $100 per ounce change in the average price of gold. PT-FI’s projected sales volumes and unit net cash costs for the year 2025 are dependent on operational performance; Indonesia regulatory approval to export copper concentrate until repairs and full ramp-up of PT-FI’s new smelter are complete; weather-related conditions; timing of shipments; and other factors. Refer to “Cautionary Statement” below, and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further discussion of factors that could cause results to differ materially from projections.

Molybdenum Mines We operate two wholly owned primary molybdenum operations in Colorado – the Climax open-pit mine and the Henderson underground mine. The Climax and Henderson mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. The majority of the molybdenum concentrate produced at the Climax and Henderson mines, as well as from our North America copper mines and South America operations, is processed at our conversion facilities. Operating and Development Activities. Production from the Molybdenum mines totaled 30 million pounds of molybdenum in both 2024 and 2023. Refer to “Consolidated Results” for our consolidated molybdenum operating data, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at our primary molybdenum operations and from our North America copper mines and South America operations. Refer to “Outlook” for projected consolidated molybdenum sales volumes and to “Markets” for a discussion of molybdenum prices. Unit Net Cash Costs per Pound of Molybdenum. We believe unit net cash costs per pound of molybdenum is a measure that provides investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Average unit net cash costs for our Molybdenum mines of $17.89 per pound of molybdenum in 2024 were higher than $15.13 per pound of molybdenum in 2023, primarily reflecting contract labor transition costs. Average unit net cash costs for the Molybdenum mines are expected to approximate $15.20 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2025, based on achievement of current sales volumes and cost estimates. Refer to “Product Revenues and Production Costs” for a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements. Smelting and Refining Through our downstream integration, we are able to assure placement of a significant portion of our copper concentrate production. PT-FI wholly owns and operates its new downstream facilities in Eastern Java, Indonesia, and has a 66% ownership interest in PT Smelting (39.5% prior to June 30, 2024), which is operated by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (refer to Note 2 for further discussion of PT Smelting). We wholly own and operate the Miami smelter in Arizona, the El Paso refinery in Texas, and Atlantic Copper smelter and refinery in Huelva, Spain. During 2024, PT-FI completed construction of its new downstream processing facilities.",

    "text": "PT-FI wholly owns and operates its new downstream facilities in Eastern Java, Indonesia, and has a 66% ownership interest in PT Smelting (39.5% prior to June 30, 2024), which is operated by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (refer to Note 2 for further discussion of PT Smelting). We wholly own and operate the Miami smelter in Arizona, the El Paso refinery in Texas, and Atlantic Copper smelter and refinery in Huelva, Spain. During 2024, PT-FI completed construction of its new downstream processing facilities. In October 2024, during start-up activities of the new smelter, a fire occurred requiring a temporary suspension of smelting operations to complete repairs (for further discussion refer to “Operations – Indonesia – Downstream Processing Facilities”). The new smelter will smelt and refine copper concentrate from PT-FI and the PMR, which commenced gold production as part of start-up activities in December 2024, will process anode slimes from the new smelter and PT Smelting. Once its new downstream processing facilities are operational, PT-FI’s operations will be fully integrated and treatment charges reflecting the cost of smelting and refining operations will be recorded in production and delivery costs. PT-FI recorded charges for operational readiness and startup costs associated with the new downstream processing facilities totaling $133 million in 2024. We estimate that operational readiness and startup costs associated with the new downstream processing facilities will approximate $120 million for the year 2025. Table of Contents 101 The Miami smelter has been operating for over 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies, improve production and comply with air quality requirements. Major maintenance turnarounds are anticipated to occur approximately every three to four years for the Miami smelter. We performed a major maintenance turnaround for the Miami smelter during 2021 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for mid-year 2025, for which we expect to incur maintenance charges and idle facility costs of approximately $85 million. Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During the year 2024, Atlantic Copper’s copper concentrate purchases included 30% from our copper mining operations and 70% from third parties. Atlantic Copper’s treatment charges, which consist of a base rate per pound of copper and per ounce of gold, are generally fixed and represent a cost to our mining operations and income to Atlantic Copper (i.e., higher treatment charges benefit our Atlantic Copper operations). Our North America copper mines are less significantly affected by changes in treatment charges because these operations are largely integrated with our Miami smelter and El Paso refinery. We defer recognizing profits on sales from our mining operations to Atlantic Copper until final sales to third parties occur. Changes in these deferrals attributable to variability in intercompany volumes resulted in net additions (reductions) to operating income totaling $21 million ($(3) million to net income attributable to common stock) in 2024 and $64 million ($37 million to net income attributable to common stock) in 2023.",

Our net deferred profits on our inventories at Atlantic Copper to be recognized in future periods’ operating income totaled $181 million ($60 million to net income attributable to common stock) at December 31, 2024. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in our net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. In May 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) amended its rule establishing standards for hazardous air pollutant emissions from primary copper smelters. This final rule will impact our Miami, Arizona smelter operations, which process a significant portion of the copper concentrate produced by our North America copper mines. We are evaluating processes and equipment modifications and the costs involved, which could be significant in connection with the revised rule requirements. Our appeal of EPA’s final rule to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is suspended, pending resolution of several petitions for reconsideration to EPA filed by us and other parties.

We closely monitor market conditions and will adjust our operating plans to protect liquidity and preserve our asset values, if necessary. We expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position as we focus on building long-term value in our business, executing our operating plans safely, responsibly and efficiently, and prudently managing costs and capital expenditures. Based on current sales volume, cost and metal price estimates and planned capital expenditures discussed in “Outlook,” our available cash and cash equivalents plus our projected consolidated operating cash flows of $6.2 billion for the year 2025 exceed our expected consolidated capital expenditures of $5.0 billion. We have cash on hand and the financial flexibility to fund capital expenditures and our other cash requirements for the next twelve months, including noncontrolling interest distributions, income tax payments, current common stock dividends (base and variable) and any share or debt repurchases. Planned capital expenditures for major mining projects over the next few years are primarily associated with underground mine development in the Grasberg minerals district and Table of Contents 102 potential expansion projects in North America. At December 31, 2024, we had $3.9 billion of consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($4.7 billion including $0.7 billion of current restricted cash associated with a portion of PT-FI’s export proceeds required to be temporarily deposited in Indonesia banks), and FCX, PT-FI and Cerro Verde have $3.0 billion, $1.5 billion and $350 million, respectively, available under their revolving credit facilities. Financial Policy. Our financial policy is aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining a solid balance sheet, providing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. The policy includes a base dividend and a performance-based payout framework, whereby up to 50% of available cash flows generated after planned capital spending and distributions to noncontrolling interest would be allocated to shareholder returns and the balance to debt reduction and investments in value enhancing growth projects, subject to us maintaining our net debt at a level not to exceed the net debt target of $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion (excluding debt for PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities). Our Board reviews the structure of the performance-based payout framework at least annually. At December 31, 2024, our net debt, excluding $3.2 billion of debt for PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities, totaled $1.06 billion. Refer to “Net Debt” for further discussion. On December 18, 2024, our Board declared cash dividends totaling $0.15 per share on our common stock (including a $0.075 per share quarterly base cash dividend and a $0.075 per share quarterly variable, performance- based cash dividend), which was paid on February 3, 2025, to shareholders of record as of January 15, 2025.",

At December 31, 2024, we had no borrowings and $7 million in letters of credit issued under our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, PT-FI had $250 million in borrowings outstanding under its $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and Cerro Verde had no borrowings under its $350 million revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion. Operating Activities We generated consolidated operating cash flows of $7.2 billion in 2024 and $5.3 billion in 2023. Higher operating cash flows in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily reflect higher average realized copper and gold prices and higher gold sales volumes, as well as working capital changes related to the timing of approval of PT-FI’s permitted copper concentrate export quota for 2024 and routine timing related impacts associated with payments to suppliers. Investing Activities Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $4.8 billion in 2024 and 2023, including amounts for major mining projects ($2.1 billion in 2024 and $1.8 billion in 2023) primarily associated with the underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district, and for PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities ($1.2 billion in 2024 and $1.7 billion in 2023).

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Commodity Price Risk Our 2024 consolidated revenues from our copper mining operations include the sale of copper concentrate, copper cathode, copper rod, gold, silver, molybdenum and other metals, the sale of molybdenum in various forms by our molybdenum operations, and the sale of copper cathode, copper anode and gold in anode and slimes by Atlantic Copper. Our financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum. For projected sensitivities of our operating cash flow to changes in commodity prices, refer to “Outlook.” World market prices for these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for further discussion of financial risks associated with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we sell. During 2024, our mined copper was sold 45% in concentrate, 34% as cathode and 21% as rod. All of our copper concentrate and some cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted LME monthly average copper settlement prices. We receive market prices based on prices in the specified future period, which results in price fluctuations recorded through revenues until the date of settlement. We record revenues and invoice customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME prices, which results in an embedded derivative on our provisionally priced concentrate and cathode sales that is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until final pricing on the date of settlement.

    "text": "We record revenues and invoice customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME prices, which results in an embedded derivative on our provisionally priced concentrate and cathode sales that is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until final pricing on the date of settlement. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs. Table of Contents 105 Following are the favorable impacts of net adjustments to the prior years’ provisionally priced copper sales for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except per share amounts): 2024 2023 Revenues $ 28 $ 183 Net income attributable to common stock $ 9 $ 62 Net income per share attributable to common stock $ 0.01 $ 0.04 At December 31, 2024, we had provisionally priced copper sales at our copper mining operations totaling 133 million pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average price of $3.96 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. We estimate that each $0.05 change in the price realized from the December 31, 2024, provisional price recorded would have an approximate $12 million effect on 2025 revenues ($4 million to net income attributable to common stock). The LME copper settlement price closed at $4.25 per pound on February 13, 2025. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The functional currency for most of our operations is the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies, including the Indonesia rupiah, Peruvian sol, Chilean peso and euro. We recognized foreign currency translation gains on balances denominated in foreign currencies totaling $17 million in 2024 and $20 million in 2023. Generally, our operating results are positively affected when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to those foreign currencies and are adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies.

Table of Contents 106 NET DEBT We believe that net debt provides investors with information related to the performance-based payout framework in our financial policy, which requires us to maintain our net debt at a level not to exceed the net debt target of $3 billion to $4 billion, excluding debt for PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities. We define net debt as consolidated debt less (i) consolidated cash and cash equivalents and (ii) current restricted cash associated with PT-FI’s export proceeds. This information differs from consolidated debt determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for consolidated debt determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Represents PT-FI’s senior notes and $250 million of borrowings under PT-FI’s revolving credit facility. PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS Mining Product Revenues and Unit Net Cash Costs (Credits) We believe unit net cash costs (credits) per pound of copper and molybdenum are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for the respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures are presented by other metals mining companies, although our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We present gross profit per pound of copper in the following tables using both a “by-product” method and a “co- product” method. We use the by-product method in our presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (i) the majority of our revenues are copper revenues, (ii) we mine ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of our costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals we produce, and (iv) it is the method used by our management and Board to monitor our operations and to compare mining operations in certain industry publications. In the co-product method presentations, shared costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent our metals sales volumes and realized prices change. We show revenue adjustments for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because these adjustments do not result from current period sales, these amounts have been reflected separately from revenues on current period sales.",

Noncash and other costs, net which are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs, consist of items such as ARO accretion and other adjustments, inventory write-offs and adjustments, stock-based compensation costs, long-lived asset impairments, idle facility costs, feasibility and optimization study costs, operational readiness and startup costs, restructuring and/or unusual charges.

Estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on metal prices for the commodities we produce and interpretations of geologic data, which may not necessarily be indicative of future results or quantities ultimately recovered. Our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, also includes forward-looking statements regarding mineral resources not included in proven and probable mineral reserves. A mineral resource, which includes measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources, is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development and Table of Contents 115 operating costs, grades, recoveries and other material modifying factors. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the estimated mineral resources will become proven and probable mineral reserves. Our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, also contains measures such as net debt and unit net cash costs (credits) per pound of copper and molybdenum, which are not recognized under U.S. GAAP. Refer to “Operations – Unit Net Cash Costs (Credits)” for further discussion of unit net cash costs (credits) associated with our operating divisions, and to “Product Revenues and Production Costs” for reconciliations of per pound costs by operating division to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to “Net Debt” for reconciliations of consolidated debt, consolidated cash and cash equivalents and current restricted cash associated with PT-FI’s export proceeds to net debt. For forward-looking unit net cash costs (credits) per pound of copper and molybdenum measures, we are unable to provide a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent upon future events, many of which are outside of our control as described above. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures are estimated consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions. Table of Contents 116 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s (the Company’s) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: • Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; • Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and • Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Phoenix, Arizona February 14, 2025 Table of Contents 118 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Tax Contingencies Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions, and its income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment, specifically as it relates to Peru and Indonesia, to determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.

Table of Contents 119 Auditing management’s tax positions involved significant auditor judgment, because management’s tax positions require a high degree of judgment and are based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for tax contingencies. This included testing controls over management’s review of the technical merits of tax positions and disputed tax assessments, including the process to measure the financial statement impact of these tax matters. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company’s accounting for these tax positions by using our knowledge of and experience with the application of respective tax laws by the relevant tax authorities, and/or our understanding of the contractual arrangements with the applicable government, if the position is governed by a contract. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the tax assessments and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We involved our tax professionals located in the respective jurisdictions to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions and to evaluate the application of relevant tax laws in the Company’s recognition determination. We obtained and assessed the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and, as applicable, third-party tax or legal opinions or other external correspondence and analyses. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in Notes 9 and 10 in relation to these tax matters. Environmental Obligations Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, including remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination. Liabilities for environmental contingencies are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s consolidated environmental obligations totaled $2.0 billion. Auditing management’s accounting for environmental obligations was challenging because significant judgment is required by the Company to estimate the future costs to remediate the environmental matters. The significant judgment was primarily due to the inherent estimation uncertainty relating to the amount of future costs. Such uncertainties involve assumptions regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the anticipated costs, scope and timing of remediation activities and required remediation methods under presently enacted laws and regulations, and allocation of costs among other potentially responsible parties. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s measurement of the environmental obligations.",

For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the environmental obligations calculations and management’s assessment to evaluate key judgments and estimates affecting the environmental obligations. To test the Company’s measurement of the environmental obligations, among other procedures, we inspected correspondence with regulatory agencies, including correspondence related to remediation activities and methods and potentially responsible parties, obtained external legal counsel confirmation letters, and inspected environmental studies. Additionally, we tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the Company’s analyses and tested the significant assumptions discussed above. We utilized our environmental professionals to search for new or contrary evidence related to the Company’s sites and to assist in evaluating the estimated future costs by comparing the estimated future costs to environmental permits, third party observable data such as vendor quotes, and to historical costs incurred for similar activities. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

    "text": "Table of Contents 125 Freeport-McMoRan Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) include the accounts of those subsidiaries where it directly or indirectly has more than 50% of the voting rights and/or has control over the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2024, the most significant entities that FCX consolidates include its 48.76%-owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC). Refer to Note 2 for further discussion, including FCX’s conclusion to consolidate PT-FI. FMC’s unincorporated joint venture at Morenci is reflected using the proportionate consolidation method (refer to Note 2). Investments in unconsolidated companies over which FCX has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not control, are accounted for under the equity method and include PT-FI’s investment in PT Smelting (refer to Note 2). Investments in unconsolidated companies owned less than 20%, and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are recorded at (i) fair value for those that have a readily determinable fair value or (ii) cost, less any impairment, for those that do not have a readily determinable fair value. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America operations, Indonesia operations and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments include the Morenci and Cerro Verde copper mines, the integrated Indonesia operations (including the Grasberg minerals district and PT-FI’s new smelter and precious metals refinery (PMR) - collectively - PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities), the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining (Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper)). Refer to Note 14 for further discussion. Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include mineral reserve estimation; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations (AROs); estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Functional Currency. The functional currency for the majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical exchange rates.",

For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are translated at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other income, net, as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency net gains totaled $17 million in 2024, $20 million in 2023 and $9 million in 2022. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are classified as a current or long- term asset based on the timing and nature of when or how the cash is expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. FCX’s restricted cash and cash equivalents are primarily related to a portion of PT-FI’s export proceeds required to be temporarily deposited in Indonesia banks for 90 days in accordance with Indonesia regulations, assurance bonds to support PT-FI’s commitment for smelter development in Indonesia, and guarantees and commitments for certain mine closure obligations. Refer to Notes 10 and 12 for further information. Table of Contents 126 Inventories. Inventories include product, materials and supplies, and mill and leach stockpiles. Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (NRV). Product. Product inventories represent copper, gold, and molybdenum products in various salable forms that are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs at our processing facilities. Product inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, such as mining, milling, smelting, leaching, solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW), refining, roasting and chemical processing. Product inventories exclude corporate general and administrative costs. Materials and Supplies, net. Materials and supplies inventory of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2024, and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023, is net of obsolescence reserves totaling $54 million at December 31, 2024, and $41 million at December 31, 2023. Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations. Estimated metals in stockpiles not expected to be recovered within the next 12 months are classified as long-term. Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted from an ore body and is available for metal recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (i.e., SX/EW). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs.",

Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities (i.e., SX/EW). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound. Each mine site maintains one work-in-process balance on a weighted-average cost basis for each process (i.e., leach, mill or concentrate leach) regardless of the number of stockpile systems at that site. Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recoveries for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recoveries for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large- scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 80% depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80% of the total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Process rates and copper recoveries for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery estimates are adjusted annually based on new information and as related technology and processing methods change. Recovery adjustments will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. For example, an increase in recovery rates increases recoverable copper in the leach stockpiles resulting in a lower weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper and a decrease in recovery rates decreases recoverable copper in the leach stockpiles and results in a higher weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. Based on an annual review of mill and leach stockpiles, FCX increased its estimated consolidated recoverable copper in certain leach stockpiles, net of joint venture interests, by 164 million pounds in 2024 and 73 million pounds in 2023. These revised estimates did not have a material impact on the weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper or FCX’s consolidated site production and delivery costs in 2024 or 2023.

Table of Contents 127 Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable mineral reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable mineral reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. For underground mines certain costs related to panel development, such as undercutting and drawpoint development, are also capitalized as mine development costs until production reaches sustained design capacity for the mine. After reaching design capacity, the underground mine transitions to the production phase and panel development costs are allocated to inventory and included as a component of production and delivery costs. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mines and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance (i.e., turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body or production of finished goods (as applicable), at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of production and delivery costs. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives for the related assets of up to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 50 years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies.",

Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s acquisition of FMC. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) measured and indicated mineral resources that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows (i.e., Level 3 measurement). Table of Contents 128 Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs (i.e., the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred.",

Stripping costs (i.e., the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 10 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to third-party legal firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the 2007 acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense.",

Environmental obligations assumed in the 2007 acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated AROs associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. AROs associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to production and delivery costs. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition. For non-operating properties and operating mines whose reclamation-related assets have been fully depreciated, changes to the ARO are recorded in production and delivery costs. At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Table of Contents 129 Revenue Recognition. FCX recognizes revenue for its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 12 for further discussion).",

Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 12 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90% to 100% of the provisional invoice amount is collected upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (London) PM gold prices. FCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 14 for a summary of revenue by product type. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average London PM gold price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the Platts Metals Daily Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment. Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock- settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCX’s stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards (i.e., cash-settled RSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using FCX’s stock price. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs using the graded-vesting method over the vesting period.

NOTE 2. OWNERSHIP IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES Ownership in Subsidiaries. FCX owns 100% of FMC. FMC produces copper and molybdenum from mines in North America and South America. At December 31, 2024, FMC’s operating mines in North America were Morenci, Bagdad, Safford (including Lone Star), Sierrita and Miami located in Arizona; Tyrone and Chino located in New Mexico; and Henderson and Climax located in Colorado. FMC has a 72% interest in Morenci (refer to “Joint Ventures. Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc.”) and owns 100% of the other North America mines. At December 31, Table of Contents 131 2024, operating mines in South America were Cerro Verde (55.08% owned - refer to “Cerro Verde” below) located in Peru and El Abra (51% owned) located in Chile. At December 31, 2024, FMC’s net assets totaled $17.4 billion and its accumulated deficit totaled $13.5 billion. FCX had no loans to FMC outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023. FCX owns 48.76% of PT-FI (refer to “PT-FI Divestment” below). At December 31, 2024, PT-FI’s net assets totaled $16.6 billion and its retained earnings totaled $12.1 billion. FCX had no loans to PT-FI outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023. FCX owns 100% of Atlantic Copper (FCX’s smelting and refining unit in Spain).

As a result of the transaction, the carrying value of Cerro Verde’s noncontrolling interest was reduced by $90 million, with $125 million recorded to capital in excess to par value, including a $5 million deferred tax impact. PT-FI Divestment. On December 21, 2018, FCX completed the transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership (the 2018 Transaction). Pursuant to the divestment agreement and related documents, PT Mineral Industri Indonesia (MIND ID), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise, acquired all of Rio Tinto plc’s (Rio Tinto) interests associated with its joint venture with PT-FI (the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture) and 100% of FCX’s interests in PT Indonesia Papua Metal Dan Mineral (PTI). In connection with the 2018 Transaction, PT-FI acquired all of the common stock of PT Rio Tinto Indonesia that held the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture interest. After the 2018 Transaction, MIND ID’s (26.24%) and PTI’s (25.00%) collective share ownership of PT-FI totals 51.24% and FCX’s share ownership totals 48.76%. The arrangements provide for FCX and the other pre-transaction PT-FI shareholders (i.e., MIND ID) to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture. As a result, FCX’s economic interest, including the attribution of net income or loss and dividends paid, in PT-FI approximated 81% through 2022 and is 48.76% in 2023 and thereafter (see “Attribution of PT-FI Net Income or Loss” below). FCX, PT-FI, PTI and MIND ID entered into a shareholders agreement (the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), which includes provisions related to the governance and management of PT-FI. FCX considered the terms of the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement and related governance structure, including whether MIND ID has substantive participating rights, and concluded that FCX has retained control and would continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements following the 2018 Transaction. Among other terms, the governance arrangements under the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement transfers control over the management of PT-FI’s mining operations to an operating committee, which is controlled by FCX. Additionally, as discussed above, the existing PT-FI shareholders retained the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former Rio Tinto Joint Venture, so that FCX’s economic interest in the project through 2041 will not be significantly affected by the 2018 Transaction. FCX believes its conclusion to continue to consolidate PT-FI in its financial statements is in accordance with the U.S.",

Attribution of PT-FI Net Income or Loss. FCX concluded that the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss from December 21, 2018 (the date of the divestment transaction), through December 31, 2022 (the Initial Period), should be based on FCX’s and MIND ID’s economic interest, as previously discussed. PT-FI’s cumulative net income during the Initial Period totaled $6.0 billion, of which $4.9 billion was attributed to FCX. Beginning January 1, 2023, the attribution of PT-FI’s net income or loss is based on equity ownership percentages (48.76% for FCX, 26.24% for MIND ID and 25.00% for PTI), except for net income in 2023 associated with the sale of approximately 190,000 ounces of gold because PT-FI did not achieve the Gold Target (as defined in the PT-FI Shareholders Agreement), and net income in 2024 associated with the closure of its 2021 corporate income tax audit and resolution of the framework for Indonesia disputed tax matters (refer to Note 9), which were attributed approximately 81% to FCX. For all of its other partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, FCX attributes net income or loss based on equity ownership percentages. Table of Contents 132 Joint Ventures. Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. FMC owns a 72% undivided interest in Morenci via an unincorporated joint venture. The remaining 28% is owned by Sumitomo (15%) and SMM Morenci, Inc. (13%). Each partner takes in kind its share of Morenci’s production. FMC purchased 15 million pounds during 2024 and 46 million pounds during 2023 of Morenci’s copper cathode from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. at market prices for $63 million and $177 million, respectively. FMC had receivables from Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc. totaling $23 million at December 31, 2024, and $17 million at December 31, 2023. PT Smelting. PT Smelting is an Indonesia company that owns a copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. In 1996, PT-FI entered into a joint venture and shareholder agreement with Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (MMC) to jointly construct the PT Smelting facilities. PT Smelting commenced operations in 1999. In December 2023, PT Smelting completed the expansion of its capacity by 30% to process approximately 1.3 million metric tons of copper concentrate per year.",

PT Smelting commenced operations in 1999. In December 2023, PT Smelting completed the expansion of its capacity by 30% to process approximately 1.3 million metric tons of copper concentrate per year. The project was funded by PT-FI with loans totaling $254 million that converted to equity effective June 30, 2024, increasing PT-FI’s common stock ownership in PT Smelting to 66% from 39.5%. MMC owns the remaining 34% of PT Smelting’s outstanding common stock and serves as the operator of the facilities. FCX has determined that PT Smelting is a variable interest entity, however, as mutual consent of both PT-FI and MMC is required to make the decisions that most significantly impact the economic performance of PT Smelting, PT-FI is not the primary beneficiary. As PT-FI has the ability to exercise significant influence over PT Smelting, PT-FI is continuing to account for its investment in PT Smelting under the equity method (refer to Note 4). PT-FI’s maximum exposure to loss is its investment in PT Smelting (refer to Note 4). PT-FI’s equity in PT Smelting’s earnings totaled $8 million in 2024, $10 million in 2023 and $24 million in 2022. Beginning January 1, 2023, PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting changed from a copper concentrate sales agreement to a tolling arrangement.

    "text": "Pension Plans. Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans. FMC Plans. FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory pension plans covering some U.S. employees and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final average monthly compensation and years of service or based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non- bargained FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan. Effective September 1, 2020, the FMC Retirement Plan, the largest FMC plan, was amended such that participants no longer accrue any additional benefits. FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans; or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. Additional contributions also may be made from time to time. FCX’s primary investment objectives for the FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) are to maintain funds sufficient to pay all benefit and expense obligations when due, minimize the volatility of the plan’s funded status to the extent practical, and to maintain prudent levels of risk consistent with the plan’s investment policy. The FMC plan assets are invested in a risk-mitigating portfolio, which is allocated among multiple fixed income managers. The current target allocation of the portfolio is long-duration credit (50%); long-duration U.S. government/ credit (20%); core fixed income (22%); long-term U.S. Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities (7%); and cash equivalents (1%). The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, historical and expected future performance on the types of assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the pension assets will earn an average of 5.20% per annum beginning January 1, 2025, which is based on the target asset allocation and long-term capital market return expectations. For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the Table of Contents 138 plans and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, FCX uses the market value of assets. Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments for service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration.",

The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-income investments for a given duration. The determination of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected future benefit payments together with the Mercer Yield Curve – Above Mean. The Mercer Yield Curve – Above Mean is constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve. The Mercer Yield Curve – Above Mean consists of spot (i.e., zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments for each of the next 30 years and is developed based on pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. SERP Plan. FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its Chairman of the Board. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump sum. The participant has elected to receive an equivalent lump sum payment. The payment will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period during the five years immediately preceding the completion of 25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s former parent company), except for benefits produced by accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the participant’s pay. PT-FI Plan. PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesia rupiah covering substantially all of its Indonesia national employees. PT-FI funds the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesia pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an exchange rate of 16,081 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2024, and 15,339 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2023. Indonesia labor laws require that companies provide a minimum severance to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s pension benefit obligation includes benefits determined in accordance with this law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its long-range estimated return for the plan based on the asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension assets will earn an average of 7% per annum beginning January 1, 2025. The discount rate assumption for PT-FI’s plan is based on the Indonesia Government Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs. Plan Information. FCX uses a measurement date of December 31 for its plans.",

The actuarial gain of $76 million in 2024 and loss of $15 million in 2023 for the FCX pension plans primarily resulted from the changes in the discount rate, which were 5.67% at December 31, 2024, 5.15% at December 31, 2023, and 5.41% at December 31, 2022.

A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security.

Cash consists primarily of short-term time deposits. Table of Contents 142 Following is a description of the valuation techniques used for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure fair value. Government bonds, common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The benefit obligation (funded status) for the postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans consisted of a current portion of $5 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $31 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2024, and a current portion of $5 million and a long-term portion of $34 million at December 31, 2023. FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering severance, long-term disability income, continuation of health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment benefit obligation consisted of a current portion of $7 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $43 million (included in other liabilities) at December 31, 2024, and a current portion of $7 million and a long-term portion of $46 million at December 31, 2023. FCX also sponsors a retirement savings plan for most of its U.S. employees. The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their income in accordance with specified guidelines. The savings plan is a qualified 401(k) plan for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees. Participants exercise control and direct the investment of their contributions and account balances among various investment options under the plan. FCX contributes to the plan and matches a percentage of employee contributions up to certain limits. For employees whose eligible compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides a nonqualified unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability balance of $69 million at December 31, 2024, and $62 million at December 31, 2023, all of which was included in other liabilities. The costs charged to operations for the employee savings plan totaled $131 million in 2024, $119 million in 2023 and $101 million in 2022.

Charges in the U.S. are not expected to generate a future tax benefit. Stock Options. Stock options granted under the plans generally expire 10 years after the date of grant and vest in one-third annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. The award agreements also provide for accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment within one year following a change of control. FCX has not granted stock options since 2021.

FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of three years or at the end of three years to certain employees. Some award agreements allow for participants to receive the following year’s vesting upon retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant of these RSU awards, FCX accelerates one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors, which vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the vesting period or the period until the director becomes retirement eligible, whichever is shorter.

At December 31, 2024, FCX had (i) U.S. foreign tax credits of $0.2 billion that will expire between 2025 and 2034, (ii) U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of $6.0 billion, of which $0.7 billion can be carried forward indefinitely, with the remainder primarily expiring between 2036 and 2037, (iii) U.S. state NOLs of $10.6 billion, of which $3.5 billion can be carried forward indefinitely, with the remainder primarily expiring between 2025 and 2044, and (iv) Atlantic Copper NOLs of $0.5 billion that can be carried forward indefinitely. Valuation Allowances. On the basis of available information at December 31, 2024, including positive and negative evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $3.0 billion at December 31, 2024, and covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits and U.S. federal NOLs, substantially all of its U.S. state and foreign NOLs, as well as a portion of its U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets. Table of Contents 148 The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits totaled $0.2 billion at December 31, 2024. FCX has operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income tax rate. Valuation allowances are recognized on foreign tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized. The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal, state and foreign NOLs totaled $1.8 billion and other deferred tax assets totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024. NOLs and deferred tax assets represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions will be realized and recognizes a valuation allowance to the extent these deductions are not expected to be realized in future periods. Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal, state and foreign NOLs and U.S.",

The $0.9 billion net decrease in the valuation allowances during 2024 is primarily related to a decrease for expirations of U.S. foreign tax credits. U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The provisions of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Act) became applicable to FCX on January 1, 2023. The Act includes, among other provisions, a new Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average annual AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. In September 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued proposed regulations that provide guidance on the application of CAMT, which are not final and subject to change. Based on the proposed guidance released by the IRS, FCX determined that the provisions of the Act did not impact its financial results for the years 2024 or 2023. Pillar Two of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules. In 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published a framework for Pillar Two of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules, which was designed to coordinate participating jurisdictions in updating the international tax system to ensure that large multinational companies pay a minimum level of income tax. Recommendations from the OECD regarding a global minimum income tax and other changes are being considered and/or implemented in jurisdictions where FCX operates. At current metals market prices, FCX does not expect enactment of the recommended framework in jurisdictions where it operates to materially impact its financial results. Indonesia Tax Matters. During 2024, in conjunction with closure of PT-FI’s 2021 corporate income tax audit and resolution of Indonesia disputed tax matters, PT-FI recorded credits to net income of $215 million, including $199 million to provision for income taxes, $8 million to production and delivery and $8 million to interest expense, net. Peru Tax Matters. Cerro Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects it to a stable income tax rate of 32% through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The enacted tax rate on dividend distributions, which is not stabilized by the agreement, is 5%. Chile Tax Matters. Under the US-Chilean Tax Treaty, which became effective in 2024, FCX’s share of income from El Abra is subject to an income tax rate of 35%. Effective January 1, 2024, mining royalty taxes in Chile consist of two main components: (i) profitability-based mining royalty rates on a sliding scale of 8% to 26% (depending on a defined operational margin) and (ii) an additional ad valorem royalty tax based on 1% of sales.

Uncertain Tax Positions. Tax positions reflected in the consolidated financial statements are, based on their technical merits, more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities or have otherwise been effectively settled. Such tax positions reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is to record accrued Table of Contents 149 interest in interest expense and accrued penalties in other income, net, rather than in the provision for income taxes. A summary of the activities associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 follows. 2024 2023 2022 Balance at beginning of year $ 720 $ 810 $ 808 Additions: Prior year tax positions 13 27 26 Current year tax positions 10 28 25 Decreases: Prior year tax positions (54) (13) (12) Settlements with taxing authorities (492) (132) (37) Lapse of statute of limitations (36) — — Balance at end of year $ 161 $ 720 $ 810 The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits was $264 million at December 31, 2024, primarily relating to unrecognized tax benefits associated with royalties and the timing of advance payments, $536 million at December 31, 2023, and $551 million at December 31, 2022. Amounts include unpaid items on the consolidated balance sheet of $26 million at December 31, 2024, $33 million at December 31, 2023, and $36 million at December 31, 2022. Benefits (charges) for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled $8 million in 2024, $(153) million in 2023 and $(7) million in 2022. The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $161 million at December 31, 2024, included $153 million ($52 million net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income taxes. Changes in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits associated with current and prior-year tax positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated with FCX’s tax treatment of cost recovery methods, various non- deductible costs, and royalties and other mining taxes. There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, but if additional settlements are agreed upon during the year 2025, FCX could experience a change in its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits.

CONTINGENCIES Environmental. FCX’s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; protection of endangered and threatened species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. FCX subsidiaries that operate in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the remediation of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment, including damages to natural resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation liability also extends to persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for the remediation if some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of FCX’s acquisition of FMC, many of the subsidiary companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those Table of Contents 150 remediation issues. Certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have caused natural resource damages (NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2024, FCX had more than 80 active remediation projects, including NRD claims, in 20 U.S. states. The largest obligations discussed below account for approximately 85% of the total balance at December 31, 2024.",

The largest obligations discussed below account for approximately 85% of the total balance at December 31, 2024. A summary of changes in FCX’s estimated environmental obligations for the years ended December 31 follows: 2024 2023 2022 Balance at beginning of year $ 1,939 $ 1,740 $ 1,664 Accretion expensea 131 119 110 Net additionsb 82 195 43 Spending (112) (115) (77) Balance at end of year 2,040 1,939 1,740 Less current portion (131) (131) (125) Long-term portion $ 1,909 $ 1,808 $ 1,615 a. Represents accretion of the fair value of environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were determined on a discounted cash flow basis. b. Primarily reflects revisions for changes in the anticipated scope and timing of projects. See further discussion below. Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an undiscounted and de-escalated basis) total $4.4 billion, including $131 million in 2025, $111 million in 2026, $122 million in 2027, $112 million in 2028, $77 million in 2029 and $3.8 billion thereafter. The amount and timing of these estimated payments will change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. At December 31, 2024, FCX’s environmental obligations totaled $2.0 billion, including $1.9 billion recorded on a discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC acquisition at fair value. FCX estimates it is reasonably possible that these obligations could range between $3.9 billion and $5.1 billion on an undiscounted and de- escalated basis. At December 31, 2024, the most significant environmental obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2024. FCX may also be subject to litigation brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of these sites follows. Pinal Creek. The Pinal Creek site was listed under the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, environmental remediation has been performed by members of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of Freeport-McMoRan Miami Inc. (Miami), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping is expected to continue for many years. During 2023, FCX recorded adjustments to the Pinal Creek environmental obligation totaling $61 million associated with a refined engineering scope and cost estimate for work to be completed within the next several years.",

    "text": "Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement, Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. Remediation work consisting of groundwater extraction and treatment plus source control capping is expected to continue for many years. During 2023, FCX recorded adjustments to the Pinal Creek environmental obligation totaling $61 million associated with a refined engineering scope and cost estimate for work to be completed within the next several years. FCX’s environmental liability balance for this site was $517 million at December 31, 2024. Newtown Creek. From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation (PDRC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, operated a copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984, a copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. Heavy industrial uses on and around the creek and discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund site and identified PDRC, four other companies and the City of Table of Contents 151 New York as potentially responsible parties (PRPs). The following year, PDRC and the four other companies (the Newtown Creek Group, NCG) and the City of New York entered an Administrative Order on Consent to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to assess the nature and extent of environmental contamination in the creek and identify remedial options. EPA approved the final RI report in April 2023. The NCG’s FS work is ongoing. EPA currently expects to approve the final FS report by April 2028, although this timeframe may be further extended. EPA is also considering performing the FS evaluation and remedy selection by creek segment. At the agency’s request, the NCG prepared a focused feasibility study (FFS) for an early action remediation project focusing on the East Branch tributary of the creek. EPA approved the FFS report and, in January 2025, the agency issued a record of decision selecting an interim remedy for the East Branch. EPA has identified 30 PRPs for the site, including the NCG members and New York City, and invited all PRPs to participate in performing the East Branch remedial design. During 2023, FCX recorded adjustments to Newtown Creek environmental obligations totaling $64 million based on updated cost estimates from the draft early action FFS and no further adjustment was considered necessary based on the issuance of the 2025 record of decision. FCX’s environmental liability balance for this site was $452 million at December 31, 2024. The scope and design of the site remedy (or remedies), final costs of the site investigation and remediation, and allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to change. Changes to the overall cost of this remedial obligation and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. Historical Smelter Sites.",

Changes to the overall cost of this remedial obligation and the portion ultimately allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. Historical Smelter Sites. FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental conditions associated with these former processing facilities. At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate on-site and off-site conditions associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible. From 1920 until 1986, United States Metals Refining Company (USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, owned and operated a copper smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of environmental investigation and remediation, under the direction and supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). On-site contamination is in the later stages of remediation. In 2012, after receiving a request from NJDEP, USMR also began investigating and remediating off-site properties, which is ongoing. As a result of off-site soil sampling in public and private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX established an environmental obligation for known and potential off-site environmental remediation; that work has been essentially completed at the end of 2024. Assessments of sediments in the adjacent Arthur Kill and possible remedial actions could result in additional adjustments to the related environmental obligation in future periods. In January 2024, the EPA released guidance lowering the recommended screening levels for investigating lead- contaminated soils from 400 to 200 parts per million (ppm) or 100 ppm where there are other sources of lead exposure (such as lead-based paint that is common in older homes). Screening levels can be used to establish cleanup levels by some agencies and more stringent cleanup levels often lead to higher costs through exponential volume increases due to resulting expanded project footprints. In January 2025, EPA published its final toxicological assessment for inorganic arsenic, which may be used to calculate cleanup levels at state and federal remediation sites and may lead to regulatory guidance, rulemaking and other regulatory activities. FCX is working with state agencies to understand possible ramifications of this guidance on its projects.",

FCX is working with state agencies to understand possible ramifications of this guidance on its projects. This EPA guidance and future changes to EPA’s lead and arsenic cleanup levels could result in increases to FCX’s environmental obligations for ongoing residential property cleanup projects near former smelter sites. FCX’s environmental liability balance for historical smelter sites, including in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey, was $266 million at December 31, 2024. Uranium Mining Sites. During a period between 1940 and the early 1980s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal lands in the Four Corners region of the Southwest. Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies have also caused environmental impacts warranting remediation. Table of Contents 152 In 2017, the Department of Justice, EPA, Navajo Nation, and two FCX subsidiaries reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the scope of the environmental investigation and remediation work for 94 former uranium mining sites on tribal lands. Under the terms of the Consent Decree executed in May 2017, and approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, the U.S. contributed $335 million into a trust fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs, and FCX’s subsidiaries are proceeding with the environmental investigation and remediation work at the 94 sites. The program is expected to take more than 20 years to complete. The Consent Decree excluded 23 former uranium mine sites at which an FCX subsidiary may also be potentially liable, but for which the U.S. recovered funds as part of a larger bankruptcy settlement with Tronox. In 2021, EPA informed an FCX subsidiary as well as two other federal entities that it does not expect to have funds sufficient to remediate all of the sites covered by the Tronox bankruptcy settlement. Based on information from EPA, it is currently considered unlikely that EPA will deplete the Tronox settlement funds in the near-term. FCX is also conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non- tribal federal lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), site surveys are being performed on approximately 15,000 mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM has issued no further action determinations for certain undisturbed claims. A similar agreement is in place with the U.S. Forest Service for mine features on U.S. Forest Service land. Either BLM or the U.S.",

    "text": "Forest Service for mine features on U.S. Forest Service land. Either BLM or the U.S. Forest Service may request additional assessment or remediation activities for other claims with mining features. FCX will update this obligation when it has a sufficient number of remedy decisions from the BLM or the U.S. Forest Service to support a reasonably certain range of outcomes. FCX expects it will take several years to complete this work. FCX’s environmental liability balance for the uranium mining sites was $473 million at December 31, 2024. AROs. FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and are based on FCX’s legal obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. A summary of changes in FCX’s AROs for the years ended December 31 follows: 2024 2023 2022 Balance at beginning of year $ 3,001 $ 3,043 $ 2,716 Liabilities incurred 16 18 9 Revisions to cash flow estimates and settlements, net 635 a 54 381 a Accretion expense 154 20 b 134 Spending (122) (134) (197) Balance at end of year 3,684 3,001 3,043 Less current portion (189) (185) (195) Long-term portion $ 3,495 $ 2,816 $ 2,848 a. Primarily reflects adjustments for oil and gas properties, Sierrita, PT-FI, Climax and Henderson for the year 2024, and PT- FI, Morenci and Bagdad for the year 2022. See further discussion below. b. Includes a $112 million adjustment at PT-FI to correct certain inputs in the historical PT-FI ARO model. ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation or other factors and as reclamation (concurrent with mining operations or post mining) spending occurs. ARO activities and expenditures for mining operations generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation activities may be accelerated if legally required or if determined to be economically beneficial. For ARO activities and expenditures for oil and gas operations, the methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time. Financial Assurance. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and other states, as well as U.S. regulations governing mine operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent company performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations, but also trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount of financial assurance FCX subsidiaries are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure requirements, and cost Table of Contents 153 estimates. At December 31, 2024, FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S.",

At December 31, 2024, FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs totaled $2.0 billion, of which $1.2 billion was in the form of guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At December 31, 2024, FCX had trust assets totaling $0.2 billion (included in other assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties in New Mexico. In addition, FCX subsidiaries have financial assurance obligations for their oil and gas properties associated with plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling $0.7 billion. Where oil and gas guarantees associated with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of the potential exposure. New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission. In connection with discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has required each of these operations to submit closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater quality standards following the closure of discharging facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water contamination to meet applicable standards. FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and the related rules that are administered by the Mining and Minerals Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, mines are required to obtain approval of reclamation plans. The agencies approved updates to the closure plan and financial assurance instruments and completed a permit renewal for Chino in 2020 and Tyrone in 2021. At December 31, 2024, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $553 million for its New Mexico operations. Additional accruals may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, and the amount of those accruals could be material. Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Arizona operations are subject to regulatory oversight by the ADEQ. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and require compliance with aquifer water quality standards during operations and closure. An application for an APP requires a proposed closure strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection requirements following cessation of operations and an estimate of the implementation cost, with a more detailed closure plan required at the time operations cease. A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ.",

A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. Closure costs for facilities covered by APPs are required to be updated every six years and financial assurance mechanisms are required to be updated every two years. During 2022, the Morenci and Bagdad mines increased their AROs by $118 million and $65 million, respectively, associated with their updated closure strategies and plans for stockpiles and tailings impoundments that were submitted to ADEQ for approval. In accordance with FCX’s commitment to the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (the Tailings Standard), in 2024 Sierrita revised its closure plan and cost estimates resulting in a $157 million increase in its AROs. FCX will continue evaluating and, as necessary, updating its closure plans and closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites, and any such updates may also result in increased costs that could be significant. Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation plans must be approved by the Arizona State Mine Inspector (ASMI) and must include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. In 2023, the ASMI requested updates to reclamation cost estimates and associated financial assurance for FCX’s Arizona mine sites, and in 2024, FCX submitted updated closure scopes of work and associated costs for Miami, Bagdad and Morenci. FCX will continue to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s AROs, and those adjustments could be material. At December 31, 2024, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $837 million for its Arizona operations and facilities. Colorado Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Colorado operations are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder, which are consistent with the Tailings Standard. Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation of mining operations. In 2024, both Henderson and Climax updated cost estimates associated with reclamation plans under the Reclamation Act and recorded a total increase of $162 million to their related AROs.",

Table of Contents 154 In 2019, Colorado enacted legislation that requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit authorizations for new mining operations and expansions beyond current permit authorizations. While this requirement does not apply to existing operations, it may lead to changes in long-term water management requirements at Climax and Henderson operations and their related AROs. As of December 31, 2024, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $351 million for its Colorado operations. Chile Reclamation and Closure Programs. El Abra is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the National Geology and Mining Service. In 2020, El Abra received approval of its updated closure plan and cost estimates, and in compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, El Abra expects to submit an updated plan with closure cost estimates in 2025. At December 31, 2024, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $105 million for its El Abra operation. Peru Reclamation and Closure Programs. Cerro Verde is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law administered by the Peru Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM). Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans, and financial assurance. In compliance with the requirement for five-year updates, Cerro Verde submitted its updated closure plan and cost estimates and received approval from MINEM in December 2023. At December 31, 2024, FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $230 million for its Cerro Verde operation. Indonesia Reclamation and Closure Programs. The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities under the circumstances, after consultation with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred after the end of mining activities, which are currently estimated to continue through 2041. In 2022, PT-FI recorded net increases to its ARO totaling $99 million related to higher estimated costs associated with West Wanagon slope stabilization remediation and increased reclamation activities and increased costs. In 2024, PT-FI recorded net increases to its ARO totaling $122 million primarily for revised reclamation plans for the Grasberg open pit area and adjustments resulting from a review and update of the PT-FI ARO model.",

Substantially all of Freeport McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC’s (FM O&G’s), FCX’s subsidiary that holds its remaining oil and gas operations, oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales transactions, FM O&G’s remaining operating areas primarily include offshore California and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM, also referred to as Gulf of America). FM O&G recorded increases to its ARO totaling $163 million in 2024 and $91 million in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, FM O&G AROs cover approximately 180 wells and 150 platforms and other structures and it had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $538 million. FM O&G’s ARO adjustments for 2024 include $116 million associated with assumed oil and gas abandonment obligations resulting from bankruptcies of other companies and were charged to production and delivery costs. FM O&G, as a predecessor-in-interest in oil and natural gas leases, is in the chain of title with unrelated third parties either directly or by virtue of divestiture of certain oil and natural gas assets previously owned and assigned by its subsidiaries. Certain counterparties in these divestiture transactions or third parties in existing leases have filed for bankruptcy protection or undergone associated reorganizations and have not performed the required abandonment obligations. Accordingly, regulations or federal laws require that other working interest owners, including FM O&G, assume such obligations. Litigation.

Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any current pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to FCX’s operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. Asbestos and Talc Claims. Since approximately 1990, various FCX affiliates have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or talc allegedly contained in industrial products such as electrical wire and cable, raw materials such as paint and joint compounds, talc-based lubricants used in rubber manufacturing or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by affiliates of FCX. Many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results to date and facts currently known, FCX believes that the amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to its consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that future developments will not alter this conclusion. There has been a significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talc-based cosmetic and personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. The primary targets have been the producers of those products, but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners. Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus Mines), a wholly owned subsidiary of CAMC, are among those targets. Cyprus Mines was engaged in talc mining and processing from 1964 until 1992 when it exited its talc business by conveying it to a third party in two related transactions. Those transactions involved (1) a transfer by Cyprus Mines of the assets of its talc business to a newly formed subsidiary that assumed all pre-sale and post-sale talc liabilities, subject to limited reservations, and (2) a sale of the stock of that subsidiary to the third party. In 2011, the third party sold that subsidiary to Imerys Talc America (Imerys), an affiliate of Imerys S.A.",

Those transactions involved (1) a transfer by Cyprus Mines of the assets of its talc business to a newly formed subsidiary that assumed all pre-sale and post-sale talc liabilities, subject to limited reservations, and (2) a sale of the stock of that subsidiary to the third party. In 2011, the third party sold that subsidiary to Imerys Talc America (Imerys), an affiliate of Imerys S.A. In accordance with the terms of the 1992 transactions and subsequent agreements, Cyprus Mines has contractual indemnification rights, subject to limited reservations, against Imerys, which historically acknowledged those indemnification obligations and took responsibility for all talc lawsuits against Cyprus Mines and CAMC tendered to it. However, in February 2019, Imerys filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which triggered an immediate automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code prohibiting any party from continuing or initiating litigation or asserting new claims against Imerys. As a result, Imerys stopped defending the talc lawsuits against Cyprus Mines and CAMC. In January 2021, Imerys filed the form of a global settlement agreement to be entered into by CAMC, Cyprus Mines, FCX, Imerys and the other debtors, tort claimants’ committee and future claims representative in the Imerys bankruptcy. In accordance with the global settlement, among other things, (1) CAMC agreed to contribute a total of $130 million in cash to a settlement trust in seven annual installments, which will be guaranteed by FCX, and (2) CAMC and Cyprus Mines and their affiliates will contribute to the settlement trust all rights that they have to the proceeds of certain legacy insurance policies as well as indemnity rights they have against Johnson & Johnson. In accordance with the settlement, Cyprus Mines commenced its bankruptcy process in February 2021, with all talc lawsuits against CAMC, Cyprus Mines and FCX being stayed. The claimants failed to approve the Imerys bankruptcy plan in 2021, which resulted in a lengthy mediation process among the interested parties. Mediation resulted in CAMC agreeing to contribute an additional $65 million over seven years to the claimant trust for a total contribution of $195 million. The claimants in both the Imerys and Cyprus Mines bankruptcy cases approved the global settlement in January 2025, which now remains subject to bankruptcy court approvals in both cases. There can be no assurance that the global settlement will be approved and successfully implemented. At December 31, 2024, FCX had a litigation reserve of $195 million associated with the proposed settlement. Tax Matters. FCX’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws.",

    "text": "Indonesia Regulatory Matters. Export Licenses. Current regulations in Indonesia prohibit exports of copper concentrate as of January 1, 2025. Pursuant to the terms of its special mining business license (IUPK) regarding force majeure events, PT-FI has requested approval from the Indonesia government to permit the export of copper concentrate in 2025 until the required repairs to its new smelter following the October 2024 fire incident and full ramp-up are complete. Long-term Mining Rights. Pursuant to regulations issued during 2024, PT-FI is eligible to apply for an extension of its mining rights beyond 2041, provided certain conditions are met, including ownership of integrated downstream facilities that have entered the operational stage; domestic ownership of at least 51% and agreement with a state- owned enterprise for an additional 10% ownership; and commitments for additional exploration and increases in refining capacity, each as approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR). Application for extension may be submitted at any time up to one year prior to the expiration of PT-FI’s IUPK. Administrative Fines. In June 2021, the MEMR, issued a ministerial decree for the calculation of an administrative fine for lack of smelter development in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2021, PT-FI recorded charges totaling $16 million for a potential settlement of the administrative fine. In January 2022, the Indonesia government submitted a new estimate of the administrative fine totaling $57 million, and in March 2022, PT-FI paid the administrative fine and recorded an additional charge of $41 million. Table of Contents 157 In May 2023, the MEMR issued a new decree prescribing a revised formula for administrative fines for delays in construction of smelting and refining facilities, taking into account allowances for certain delays associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as verified by a third-party. In mid-July 2023, PT-FI submitted its third-party verified calculation, which resulted in an accrual for a potential administrative fine of $55 million based on the formula prescribed by the decree related to the period from August 2020 through January 2022. In December 2024, the Indonesia government assessed PT-FI a $59 million administrative fine for delays in development of the new downstream processing facilities related to the period from August 2020 through January 2022. As a result, PT-FI increased its accrual by $4 million at December 31, 2024. Smelter Assurance. The May 2023 decree issued by MEMR also required assurance in the form of an escrow account, which can be withdrawn if smelter development progress is at least 90% on June 10, 2024. During 2023, PT-FI deposited $10 million in a joint account with the Indonesia government while it continued to discuss the applicability of the May 2023 decree. At December 31, 2024, development of PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities was complete; as such, PT-FI does not believe additional deposits are necessary.

Refer to Note 12 for discussion of PT-FI’s assurance bonds to support its commitment for smelter development in Indonesia. Export Proceeds. In accordance with a regulation issued by the Indonesia government in 2023, 30% of PT-FI’s gross export proceeds are being temporarily deposited into Indonesia banks for a period of 90 days before withdrawal. At December 31, 2024, FCX had $0.7 billion in current restricted cash and cash equivalents deposited in Indonesia banks in accordance with this regulation. The Indonesia government is considering changes to this regulation, which could increase the amount and length of the requirement, but also allow withdrawals from the balances to fund business requirements. The details of the modifications have not been finalized. Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds. Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $638 million at December 31, 2024, primarily associated with reclamation and AROs, and copper concentrate shipments from PT-FI to Atlantic Copper as required by Indonesia regulations. In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling $504 million at December 31, 2024, primarily associated with environmental obligations and AROs. Insurance. FCX purchases a variety of insurance products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. workers’ compensation but purchases excess insurance up to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ compensation, to estimate expected losses. At December 31, 2024, FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance programs totaled $54 million, which consisted of a current portion of $14 million (included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $40 million (included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables of $18 million (a current portion of $9 million included in other accounts receivable and a long-term portion of $9 million included in other assets) for expected claims associated with these losses to be filed with insurance carriers.

Transportation obligations are primarily associated with contracted ocean freight agreements for our South America and Indonesia operations. Electricity obligations are primarily for long- term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. Table of Contents 159 FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations total $1.8 billion in 2025, $1.1 billion in 2026, $0.4 billion in 2027, $0.2 billion in 2028, $0.1 billion in 2029 and $0.1 billion thereafter. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase obligations. IUPK – Indonesia. In December 2018, FCX completed the 2018 Transaction with the Indonesia government regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights and share ownership. Concurrent with the closing of the 2018 Transaction, the Indonesia government granted PT-FI an IUPK to replace its former contract of work. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI was granted an extension of mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend mining rights through 2041, subject to PT-FI completing the development of additional smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. The IUPK, and related documentation, contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041, assuming the additional extension is received. In addition, FCX, as a foreign investor, has rights to resolve investment disputes with the Indonesia government through international arbitration. The key fiscal terms set forth in the IUPK include a 25% corporate income tax rate, a 10% profits tax on net income, and royalty rates of 4% for copper, 3.75% for gold and 3.25% for silver. PT-FI’s royalties charged against revenues totaled $433 million in 2024, $338 million in 2023 and $357 million in 2022. Dividend distributions from PT-FI to FCX totaled $1.5 billion in 2024, $0.4 billion in 2023 and $2.5 billion in 2022, and are subject to a 10% withholding tax. Export Duties. The IUPK required PT-FI to pay export duties of 5%, declining to 2.5% when smelter development progress exceeded 30% and eliminated when development progress for additional smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia exceeded 50%. In December 2022, PT-FI received approval, based on construction progress achieved, for a reduction in export duties from 5% to 2.5%, which was effective immediately. In March 2023, the Indonesia government further verified that construction progress of the new smelter exceeded 50% and PT-FI’s export duties were eliminated effective March 29, 2023. In July 2023, the Ministry of Finance issued a revised regulation on duties for various exported products, including copper concentrates. Under the revised regulation PT-FI was assessed export duties for copper concentrates at 7.5% in the second half of 2023 (totaling $307 million).",

As of December 31, 2023, construction progress of PT-FI’s smelter projects exceeded 90%; however, PT-FI was subject to the 10% export duty during 2024 until it received a revised concentrate export license. In July 2024, PT-FI was granted copper concentrate and anode slimes export licenses, which were valid through December 2024, subjecting PT-FI to a 7.5% export duty. PT-FI’s export duties totaled $457 million in 2024, $324 million in 2023 and $307 million in 2022. Indemnification. The PT-FI divestment agreement, discussed in Note 2, provides that FCX will indemnify MIND ID and PTI from any losses (reduced by receipts) arising from any tax disputes of PT-FI disclosed to MIND ID in a Jakarta, Indonesia, tax court letter limited to PTI’s respective percentage share at the time the loss is finally incurred. Any net obligations arising from any tax settlement would be paid on December 21, 2025. FCX had accrued $49 million as of December 31, 2024, (included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets) and $75 million as of December 31, 2023, (included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets) related to this indemnification. Cobalt Business. In September 2021, FCX’s 56%-owned subsidiary, Koboltti Chemicals Holdings Limited (KCHL), completed the sale of its remaining cobalt business based in Kokkola, Finland (Freeport Cobalt) to Jervois Global Limited (Jervois) for $208 million (before post-closing adjustments), consisting of cash consideration of $173 million and 7% of Jervois common stock (valued at $35 million at the time of closing). In 2022, KCHL sold these shares for $60 million. In addition, KCHL has the right to receive contingent consideration through 2026 of up to $40 million based on the future performance of Freeport Cobalt. Any gain related to the contingent consideration will be recognized when received. Following this transaction, FCX no longer has cobalt operations. Community Development Programs. FCX has adopted policies that govern its working and engagement relationships with the communities where it operates. These policies are designed to guide FCX’s practices and programs in a manner that respects and promotes basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by FCX’s operations.

Table of Contents 160 PT-FI provides funding and technical assistance to support various community development and empowerment programs in areas such as health, education, economic development and local infrastructure. In 1996, PT-FI established a social investment fund with the aim of contributing to social and economic development in the Mimika Regency. In 2019, a new foundation, the Amungme and Kamoro Community Empowerment Foundation (Yayasan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Amungme dan Kamoro, or YPMAK) was established, and in 2020, PT-FI appointed YPMAK to assist in distributing a significant portion of PT-FI’s funding to support the development and empowerment of the local Indigenous Papuan people. YPMAK is governed by a Board of Governors consisting of seven representatives of Indigenous Kamoro-Amungme, PT-FI and Mind ID. In addition, since 2001, PT-FI has voluntarily established and contributed to land rights trust funds administered by Amungme and Kamoro representatives that focus on socioeconomic initiatives, human rights and environmental issues. PT-FI is committed to the continued funding of YPMAK programs and the land rights trust funds, as well as for other local-community development initiatives through the end of PT-FI's IUPK in support of public health, education, local economic development and empowerment. PT-FI recorded charges to production and delivery costs totaling $141 million in 2024 and $123 million in both 2023 and 2022 for social and economic development programs. Guarantees. FCX provides certain financial guarantees (including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) and indemnities. Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, buyers or other parties related to the transaction from and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity classifications include environmental, tax and certain operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential exposure. Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities.",

Except as described in the following sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs from these guarantees are accrued when potential environmental obligations are considered by management to be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. NOTE 12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Commodity Contracts. From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. Table of Contents 161 A discussion of FCX’s derivative contracts and programs follows. Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments – Fair Value Hedges Copper Futures and Swap Contracts. Some of FCX’s U.S. copper rod and cathode customers request a fixed market price instead of the COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness during the three years ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for 109 million pounds at an average contract price of $4.31 per pound, with maturities through November 2026.

Summary of (Losses) Gains. A summary of realized and unrealized (losses) gains recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, including on the related hedged item for the years ended December 31 follows: 2024 2023 2022 Copper futures and swap contracts: Unrealized (losses) gains: Derivative financial instruments $ (32) $ 3 $ (11) Hedged item – firm sales commitments 32 (3) 11 Realized gains (losses): Matured derivative financial instruments 29 (4) (63) Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Embedded Derivatives. Certain FCX sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the COMEX copper price and the London gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded in revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX copper prices and the London gold price as specified in the contracts, which results in an embedded derivative (i.e., a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate, cathode or anode slimes at the then-current LME copper, COMEX copper or London gold prices. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate, cathode and anode slime sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold price, until the date of final pricing. Similarly, FCX purchases copper under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in inventory for purchase contracts.

FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which it has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was $20 million. Other Financial Instruments. Other financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, legally restricted trust assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, dividends payable and debt.

Table of Contents 164 NOTE 13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).

The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (which are usually within one business day of notice). Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities (government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage-backed securities) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Table of Contents 166 Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the adjusted London gold prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 12 for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note 12 for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME forward prices. In December 2016, FCX’s sale of its Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties included up to $150 million in contingent consideration (to be received over time) that was recorded at the total amount under the loss recovery approach. The fair value of this contingent consideration was calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs that include third-party estimates for reserves, production rates and production timing, and discount rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in the market, the contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In third-quarter 2024, FCX determined that only $4 million of the remaining balance was collectible and recorded a net impairment of $32 million (consisting of a $42 million impairment to the contingent consideration receivable and an offsetting reduction of $10 million to the related overriding royalty interest payable). Long-term debt, including current portion, is primarily valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The techniques described above may produce a fair value that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at December 31, 2024, as compared to those techniques used at December 31, 2023. Table of Contents 167 NOTE 14.

Labor Matters. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 28% of FCX’s global labor force was covered by collective labor agreements (CLAs), none of which will expire during 2025. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America operations, Indonesia operations and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable segments, which include the Morenci and Cerro Verde copper mines, the Indonesia operations (including the Grasberg minerals district and PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities), the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. FCX's Chief Executive Officer is identified as its CODM under business segment reporting guidance. Operating income (loss) is the financial measure of profit or loss used by the CODM to review segment results, and the significant segment expenses reviewed by the CODM are consistent with the operating expense line items presented in FCX’s consolidated statements of income. The CODM uses operating income (loss) to assess segment performance against forecasted results and to allocate resources, including capital investment in mining operations and potential expansions. The 2023 and 2022 tables have been adjusted to conform with the current year presentation, primarily for the combination of the Grasberg minerals district and PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities. PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities will exclusively receive concentrate from the Grasberg minerals district, which reflects PT-FI’s integrated and dependent operations within Indonesia (i.e., Indonesia operations). The PMR will receive anode slimes from the smelter and from PT Smelting. FCX's CODM makes executive management decisions, including resource allocation and mine planning, for the Indonesia operations as a single business segment. Table of Contents 169 Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arm’s-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, the timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. FCX defers recognizing profits on intercompany sales to Atlantic Copper until final sales to third parties occur. Until December 31, 2022, FCX also deferred recognizing 39.5% of PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting, until final sales to third parties occurred. Beginning in 2023, PT-FI’s commercial arrangement with PT Smelting changed to a tolling arrangement and there were no further sales from PT-FI to PT Smelting during 2023 and 2024. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments.",

Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, some selling, general and administrative costs are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual reportable segments. Accordingly, the following segment information reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or reportable segment would be if it was an independent entity. North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America – Morenci, Safford (including Lone Star), Bagdad, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver. The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces molybdenum concentrate. During 2024, the Morenci mine produced 41% of FCX’s North America copper and 12% of FCX’s consolidated copper production. South America Operations. South America operations includes two operating copper mines – Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. During 2024, the Cerro Verde mine produced 81% of FCX’s South America copper and 23% of FCX’s consolidated copper production. Indonesia Operations. Indonesia operations include PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver, and PT-FI’s new downstream processing facilities. During 2024, PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district produced 43% of FCX’s consolidated copper production and 99% of FCX’s consolidated gold production. Molybdenum Mines. Molybdenum mines include the wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open- pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery and two rod mills, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance.",

Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, and includes a refinery and two rod mills, which are combined in accordance with segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper mines and purchased copper into copper cathode and rod. At times these operations refine copper and produce copper rod for customers on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the specified products. Table of Contents 170 Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During 2024, Atlantic Copper purchased 2% of its concentrate requirements from FCX’s North America copper mines, 15% from FCX’s South America operations and 13% from FCX’s Indonesia operations, with the remainder purchased from unaffiliated third parties. Corporate, Other & Eliminations. Corporate, Other & Eliminations consists of FCX’s other mining, oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination items, which include the Miami smelter, molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and Europe, certain non-operating copper mines in North America (Ajo, Bisbee and Tohono in Arizona) and other mining support entities.",

FCX’s proven and probable mineral reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. Proven and probable mineral reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry. Mineral reserves, as used in the reserve data presented here, mean an estimate of tonnage and grade of measured and indicated mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. Proven mineral reserves are the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. To classify an estimate as a proven mineral reserve, the qualified person must possess a high degree of confidence of tonnage, grade and quality. Probable mineral reserves are the economically mineable part of an indicated or, in some cases, a measured mineral resource. The qualified person’s level of confidence will be lower in determining a probable mineral reserve than it would be in determining a proven mineral reserve. To classify an estimate as a probable mineral reserve, the qualified person’s confidence must still be sufficient to demonstrate that extraction is economically viable considering reasonable investment and market assumptions. FCX’s mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing studies of its ore bodies to evaluate economic values and to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2024, were determined using metals price assumptions of $3.25 per pound for copper, $1,600 per ounce for gold and $12.00 per pound for molybdenum. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, LME copper settlement prices averaged $4.00 per pound, London PM gold prices averaged $2,044 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Platts Metals Daily averaged $21.41 per pound. The recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recoveries and smelter recoveries, where applicable.

Estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves from Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through 2041. As a result, PT-FI’s current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041 (refer to Note 11 for discussion of PT-FI’s IUPK). As a result, PT-FI will not mine all of these mineral reserves during the initial term of the IUPK. Prior to the end of 2031, PT-FI expects to mine 40% of its recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2024, representing 45% of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 44% of FCX’s net equity share of recoverable gold reserves in Indonesia. c.

Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement As previously reported, Kathleen L. Quirk, the President of FCX, was promoted to the additional role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of FCX effective June 11, 2024. In light of her expanded responsibilities, on February 11, 2025, she and FCX entered into an Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement (the Agreement), which amends and restates the Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement between FCX and Ms. Quirk dated effective December 2, 2008, and amended effective April 27, 2011 (the Prior Agreement). The Agreement reflects Ms. Quirk’s roles with FCX and includes other updates to incorporate current market practices. The Agreement is effective through December 31, 2027, after which it will automatically renew for additional one- year periods unless prior written notice of non-renewal is provided to the other party in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. The principal terms of the Agreement are substantially similar to the Prior Agreement and does not change Ms. Quirk’s current compensation, although her base salary has been updated to reflect her base salary as of the date she assumed the role of CEO. The Agreement revises certain potential severance benefits to better align with current market practices. Specifically, in connection with a termination without Cause or with Good Reason unrelated to a Change in Control (as such terms are defined in the Agreement), the severance payment multiple has been reduced from three times to two times. In connection with a termination without Cause or with Good Reason related to a Change in Control, the multiple remains at three times, but the protected period has been reduced from three years to two years and includes a limited pre-Change in Control period.",

In addition, the severance payment related to a Change in Control will be calculated using the three-year average bonus (instead of the highest bonus during that period), and the pro-rated bonus for the year of termination will likewise be based on the three-year average bonus (instead of actual results for the year). The benefit continuation period in connection with all qualifying terminations has been reduced from three years to two years. The Agreement also requires Ms. Quirk to deliver a release in favor of FCX in order to receive certain severance benefits, extends Ms. Quirk’s limited covenant not to compete from six months to eighteen months post-termination, and specifically confirms the application of FCX’s Incentive-Based Compensation Recovery Policy on Ms. Quirk’s compensation, where applicable.

Item 16. Form 10-K Summary. Not applicable. GLOSSARY OF TERMS Following is a glossary of selected terms used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are technical in nature: Adits. A horizontal passage leading into a mine for the purposes of access or drainage. Alluvial aquifers. A water-bearing deposit of loosely arranged gravel, sand or silt left behind by a river or other flowing water. Anode. A positively charged metal sheet, usually lead, on which oxidation occurs. During the electro-refining process, anodes are impure copper sheets from the smelting process that require further processing to produce refined copper cathode. Table of Contents 184 Azurite. A bluish supergene copper mineral and ore found in the oxidized portions of copper deposits often associated with malachite. Bench. The horizontal floor cuttings along which mining progresses in an open-pit mine. As the pit progresses to lower levels, safety benches are left in the walls to catch any falling rock. Blasthole stoping. An underground mining method that extracts the ore zone in large vertical rooms. The ore is broken by blasting using large-diameter vertical drill holes. Block cave. A general term used to describe an underground mining method where the extraction of ore depends largely on the action of gravity. By continuously removing a thin horizontal layer at the bottom mining level of the ore column, the vertical support of the ore column is removed and the ore then caves by gravity. Bornite.",

By continuously removing a thin horizontal layer at the bottom mining level of the ore column, the vertical support of the ore column is removed and the ore then caves by gravity. Bornite. A red-brown isometric mineral comprising copper, iron and sulfur. British thermal unit or Btu. One British thermal unit is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Brochantite. A greenish-black copper mineral occurring in the oxidation zone of copper sulfide deposits. Cathode. Refined copper produced by electro-refining of impure copper or by electrowinning. Chalcocite. A grayish copper sulfide mineral, usually found as a supergene in copper deposits formed from the re- deposition of copper minerals that were solubilized from the oxide portion of the deposit. Chalcopyrite. A brass-yellow sulfide of mineral copper and iron. Chrysocolla. A bluish-green to emerald-green oxide copper mineral that forms incrustations and thin seams in oxidized parts of copper-mineral veins; a source of copper and an ornamental stone. Cobalt. A tough, lustrous, nickel-white or silvery-gray metallic element often associated with nickel and copper ores from which it is obtained as a by-product. Concentrate. The resulting product from the concentrating process that is composed predominantly of copper sulfide or molybdenum sulfide minerals. Further processing might include smelting and electro-refining, or roasting. Concentrating. The process by which ore is separated into metal concentrate through crushing, milling and flotation. Concentrator. A process plant used to separate targeted minerals from gangue and produce a mineral concentrate that can be marketed or processed by additional downstream processes to produce salable metals or mineral products. Term is used interchangeably with Mill. Contained metal. The amount of metal in a mineral sample before the reduction of amounts unable to be recovered during the metallurgical process. Covellite. A metallic, indigo-blue supergene mineral found in copper deposits. Crushed-ore leach pad. A slightly sloping pad upon which leach ores are placed in lifts for processing. Cutoff grade. The minimum grade contained in the ore for processing. When percentages are below this grade, the material would be routed to an overburden stockpile or left unmined. When percentages are above grade, the material would be processed using concentrating or leaching methods. Disseminations. A mineral deposit in which the desired minerals occur as scattered particles in the rock that has sufficient quantity to be considered an ore deposit. Electrolytic refining. The purification of metals by electrolysis. A large piece of impure copper is used as the anode with a thin strip of pure copper as the cathode. Electrowinning. A process that uses electricity to plate copper contained in an electrolyte solution into copper cathode. Table of Contents 185 Flotation. A concentrating process in which valuable minerals attach themselves to bubbles of an oily froth for separation as concentrate. The gangue material from the flotation process reports as a tailing product. Grade. The relative quality or percentage of metal content. Indigenous Peoples.",

Millable ore that has been mined, and is available for future processing. Mine-for-leach. A mining operation focused on mining only leachable ores. Also, referred to as crushed leach. Mineralization. The process by which a mineral is introduced into a rock, resulting in concentration of minerals that may form a valuable or potentially valuable deposit. Molybdenite. A black, platy, disulfide of molybdenum. It is the most common ore of molybdenum. Ore body. A continuous, well-defined mass of mineralized material of sufficient ore content to make extraction economically feasible. Oxide. In mining, oxide is used as an ore classification relating to material that usually leaches well but does not perform well in a concentrator. Oxide minerals in mining refer to an oxidized form. Paste backfill. A slurry of paste material produced from tailings with engineered cement and water content that is used to fill underground mined out stopes. Porphyry. A deposit in which minerals of copper, molybdenum, gold or, less commonly, tungsten and tin are disseminated or occur in stock-work of small veinlets within a large mass of hydro-thermally altered igneous rock. The host rock is commonly an intrusive porphyry, but other rocks intruded by a porphyry can also be hosts for ore minerals. Production level. With respect to underground mining, the elevation of the underground works that permit extraction/ transport of the ore to a common point, shaft or plant. Pseudomalachite. A dark-green monoclinic copper mineral. Roasting. The heating of sulfide ores to oxidize sulfides to facilitate further processing. Run-of-Mine (ROM). Leachable ore that is mined and directly placed on a leach pad without utilizing any further processes to reduce particle size prior to leaching. Skarn. A Swedish mining term for silicate gangue of certain iron ore and sulfide deposits of Archaean age, particularly those that have replaced limestone and dolomite. Its meaning has been generally expanded to include lime-bearing silicates, of any geologic age, derived from nearly pure limestone and dolomite with the introduction of large amounts of silicon, aluminum, iron and magnesium. Smelting. The process of melting and oxidizing concentrate to separate copper and precious metals from metallic and non-metallic impurities, including iron, silica, alumina and sulfur. Solution extraction. A process that transfers copper from a copper-bearing ore to an organic solution, then to an electrolyte.",

Solution extraction. A process that transfers copper from a copper-bearing ore to an organic solution, then to an electrolyte. The electrolyte is then pumped to a tankhouse where the copper is extracted, using electricity, into a copper cathode (refer to the term Electrowinning), together referred to as solution extraction/electrowinning (SX/ EW). Table of Contents 186 Stope. An underground mining method that is usually applied to highly inclined or vertical veins. Ore is extracted by driving horizontally upon it in a series of workings, one immediately over the other. Each horizontal working is called a stope because when a number of them are in progress, each working face under attack assumes the shape of a flight of stairs. Sulfide. A mineral compound containing sulfur and a metal. Copper sulfides can be concentrated or leached, depending on the mineral type. Tailings. The crushed and ground material remaining after economically recoverable minerals have been extracted. In upstream design and construction, tailings are deposited on the upstream side of the starter embankment, with subsequent crest raises progressively shifting upstream of each previous raise, using deposited tailings as a foundation. In downstream design and construction, tailings are deposited on the upstream side of the starter embankment. Borrow fill or a portion of the tailings are placed on the downstream side of the starter embankment. Subsequent crest raises progressively shift downstream of each previous raise, such that the previous raise becomes the foundation of the subsequent raise. As a result, the toe and the crest of the embankment progressively shift downstream as the embankment is raised. In centerline design and construction, tailings are deposited on the upstream side of the starter embankment. Borrow fill or a portion of the tailings are placed on the crest of the starter embankment. Subsequent crest raises are constructed vertically along the centerline of the previous raise such that the previous raise becomes the foundation of the subsequent raise. As a result, the toe of the embankment shifts downstream but the crest stays along initial alignment as the embankment is raised. Tolling. The process of converting customer-owned material into specified products, which is then returned to the customer. Working interest. An interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.

CC BY 4.0. Abstract The Global EV Outlook is an annual publication that identifies and assesses recent developments in electric mobility across the globe. It is developed with the support of members of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI). Combining analysis of historical data with projections – now extended to 2035 – the report examines key areas of interest such as the deployment of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, battery demand, investment trends, and related policy developments in major and emerging markets. It also considers what wider EV adoption means for electricity and oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The report includes analysis of lessons learned from leading markets, providing information for policy mak ers and stakeholders on policy frameworks and market systems that support electric vehicle uptake. This edition also features analysis of electric vehicle affordability, second- hand markets, lifecycle emissions of electric cars and their batteries, and grid impacts from charging medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks. Two online tools are made available alongside the report: the Global EV Data Explorer and the Global EV Policy Explorer, which allow users to interactively explore EV statistics and projections, and policy measures worldwide.

CC BY 4.0. Executive summary Growth in electric car sales remains robust as major markets progress and emerging economies ramp up Electric car sales keep rising and could reach around 17 million in 2024, accounting for more than one in five cars sold worldwide. Electric cars continue to make progress towards becoming a mass -market product in a larger number of countries. Tight margins, volatile battery metal prices, high inflation, and the phase- out of purchase incentives in some countries have sparked concerns about the industry’s pace of growth, but global sales data remain strong. In the first quarter of 2024, electric car sales grew by around 25% compared with the first quarter of 2023, similar to the year-on-year growth seen in the same period in 2022. In 2024, the market share of electric cars could reach up to 45% in China, 25% in Europe and over 11% in the United States, underpinned by competition among manufacturers, falling battery and car prices, and ongoing policy support. Growth expectations for 2024 build on a record year: in 2023, global sales of electric cars neared 14 million, reaching 18% of all cars sold. This is up from 14% in 2022. Electric car sales in 2023 were 3.5 million higher than in 2022, a 35% year -on-year increase.",

Electric car sales in 2023 were 3.5 million higher than in 2022, a 35% year -on-year increase. This indicates robust growth even as many major markets enter a new phase, with uptake shifting from early adopters to the mass market. Over 250 000 electric cars were sold every week last year, more than the number sold in a year just a decade ago. Chinese carmakers produced more than half of all electric cars sold worldwide in 2023, despite accounting for just 10% of global sales of cars with internal combustion engines. The pace at which electric car sales pick up in emerging and developing economies outside China will determine their global success. The vast majority of electric car sales in 2023 were in China (60%), Europe (25%) and the United States (10%). By comparison, these regions accounted for around 65% of total car sales worldwide, showing that sales of electric models remain more geographically concentrated than those of conventional ones. While electric car sales in emerging economies have been lagging those in the three big markets, growth picked up in 2023 in countries such as Viet Nam (around 15% of all cars sold) and Thailand (10%). In emerging economies with large car markets, shares are still relatively low, but several factors point to further growth. Policy measures such as purchase subsidies and incentives for electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing are playing a key role. In India (where electric cars have a 2% market share), the Production Linked Incentives (PLI) Scheme is supporting domestic manufacturing. In Brazil (3% share), Indonesia, Malaysia (2% share Global EV Outlook 2024 Executive Summary PAGE | 12 IEA. CC BY 4.0. each), and Thailand, cheaper models, mainly from Chinese brands, are underpinning uptake. In Mexico, EV supply chains are rapidly developing, stimulated by access to subsidies from the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Policy support is boosting industry investment, building confidence that rapid electrification will continue Every other car sold globally in 2035 is set to be electric based on today’s energy, climate and industrial policy settings, as reflected in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario. This has significant impacts on the car fleet. As soon as 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is electric in this scenario, and almost one in five in both the United States and European Union. The rapid uptake of EVs of all types – cars, vans, trucks, buses and two/three -wheelers – avoids 6 million barrels per day (mb/d) of oil demand in the Stated Policies Scenario in 2030, and over 10 mb/d in 2035. This is equivalent to the amount of oil used for road transport in the United States today. Recent policy developments continue to reinforce expectations for swift electrification, such as new emissions standards adopted in Canada, the European Union and the United States over the past year.",

This is equivalent to the amount of oil used for road transport in the United States today. Recent policy developments continue to reinforce expectations for swift electrification, such as new emissions standards adopted in Canada, the European Union and the United States over the past year. Industrial incentives – such as those in the US IRA, the EU Net Zero Industry Act, China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, and India’s PLI schem e – also encourage adding value and creating jobs across EV supply chains in those economies . If all the national energy and climate targets made by governments are met in full and on time, as in the Announced Pledges Sc enario, two-thirds of all vehicles sold in 2035 could be electric, avoiding around 12 mb/d of oil. Expectations of strong growth are bolstering investment in the EV supply chain. Recent reporting shows that from 2022 to 2023, investment announcements in EV and battery manufacturing totalled almost USD 500 billion, of which around 40% has been committed. Over 20 major car manufacturers, representing more than 90% of global car sales in 2023, have set electrification targets. Taking the targets of all the largest automakers together, more than 40 million electric cars could be sold in 2030, which would meet the level of deployment projected under today’s policy settings. Enough battery manufacturing capacity has reached a final investment decision to deliver on announced pledges from automakers and governments globally. Thanks to high levels of investment in the past 5 years, global EV battery manufacturing capacity far exceeded demand in 2023, at around 2.2 terawatt-hours and 750 gigawatt-hours, respectively. Demand is likely to grow quickly: up seven times by 2035 compared with 2023 in the Stated Policies Scenario, nine times in the Announced Pledges Scenario, and 12 times in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which lays out a pathway to reach net zero energy sector emissions by mid-century. Manufacturing capacity appears capable of keeping pace with demand: committed and existing battery manufacturing Global EV Outlook 2024 Executive Summary PAGE | 13 IEA. CC BY 4.0. capacity alone are practically aligned with the needs in a net zero pathway in 2030. Such prospects are opening significant opportunities across the supply chain for battery and mining companies, including in emerging markets outside China, although surplus capacity has been hurting margins and may lead to further market consolidation. The pace of the transition to electric vehicles hinges on their affordability Electric cars are getting cheaper as competition intensifies, particularly in China, but they remain more expensive than cars with internal combustion engines in other markets. A rapid transition to EVs will require bringing to market more affordable models. In China, we estimate that more than 60% of electric cars sold in 2023 were already cheaper than their average combustion engine equivalent.",

A rapid transition to EVs will require bringing to market more affordable models. In China, we estimate that more than 60% of electric cars sold in 2023 were already cheaper than their average combustion engine equivalent. However, electric cars remain 10% to 50% more expensive than combustion engine equivalents in Europe and the Uni ted States, depending on the country and car segment. In 2023, two- thirds of available electric models globally were large cars, pick -up trucks or sports utility vehicles, pushing up average prices. When exactly price parity is reached is subject to a range of market variables, but current trends suggest that it could be reached by 2030 in major EV markets outside China for most models. The pricing strategies of car manufacturers will be crucial for improving affordability, as will the pace of EV battery price decline. Turmoil in battery metal markets in 2022 led to the first price increase for lithium -ion packs, which became 7% more expensive than in 2021. In 2023, however, the prices of the key metals used to make batteries dropped, leading to a near-14% fall in pack prices year-on-year. China still supplies the cheapest batteries, but prices across regions are converging as batteries become a globalised commodity. Lithium -iron- phosphate batteries – which are significantly cheaper than those based on lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt oxide – accounted for over 40% of global EV sales by capacity in 2023, more than double their share in 2020. Looking ahead, technological innovation will remain important for scaling up novel designs and chemistries such as sodium-ion batteries, which could cost as much as 20% less than lithium-based batteries without requiring any lithium. In developing economies outside China, more affordable electric car models are arriving, and the future of electric two- and three-wheelers already looks bright. In 2023, 55% to 95% of the electric car sales across major emerging and developing economies were large models that are unaffordable for the average consumer, hindering mass -market uptake. However, smaller and much more affordable models launched in 2022 and 2023 have quickly become bestsellers, especially those by Chinese carmakers expanding overs eas. Affordable electric two- and three- wheelers are also already available, helping deliver immediate Global EV Outlook 2024 Executive Summary PAGE | 14 IEA. CC BY 4.0. benefits such as improved air quality and emissions reductions. Around 1.3 million electric two-wheelers were sold in India and Southeast Asia in 2023, accounting for 5% and 3% of total sales, respectively. One in five three-wheelers sold globally in 2023 was electric, and nearly 60% of those sold in India, boosted by the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME II) subsidy scheme. As electric vehicle markets mature, second- hand electric cars will become more widely available.",

As electric vehicle markets mature, second- hand electric cars will become more widely available. In 2023, the market size for used electric cars was around 800 000 in China, 400 000 in the United States, and over 450 000 across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The prices of used electric cars are falling quickly and becoming competitive with combustion engine equivalents. Looking ahead, international trade of used electric cars is also expected to increase, including to emerging and developing economies outside of China. The battery recycling industry is getting ready for the 2030s. Recycling and reuse are needed for supply chain sustainability and security. M any technology developers are seeking to position themselves in EV end -of-life markets, but planned locations do not always align with where EV retirement may occur. Global battery recycling capacity reached 300 gigawatt-hours in 2023. If all announced projects materialise, it could exceed 1 500 gigawatt-hours in 2030, of which 70% would be in China. Globally, announced recycling capacity is more than three times the supply of batteries that could potentially be recycled in 2030, as EVs reach their end of life in the A nnounced Pledges Scenario. However, EV battery retirement is expected to grow rapidly from the second half of the 2030s. The roll-out of public charging needs to keep pace with EV sales The global number of installed public charging points was up 40% in 2023 relative to 2022, and growth for fast chargers outpaced that of slower ones. In major EV markets, the deployment of charging points is continuing apace thanks to targeted policies. Broad, affordable access to public charging infrastructure will be needed for a mass-market switch to electric transport and to enable longer journeys – even if most charging continues to take place private ly in residential and workplace settings. To reach E V deployment levels in the Announced Policies Scenario, public charging needs to increase sixfold by 2035. As more electric heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and large buses hit the road, dedicated and flexible charging is needed. In 2023, electric buses accounted for 3% of total bus sales. Electric truck sales jumped 35% compared with 2022, accounting for about 3% of truck sales in China and 1.5% in Europe. Under today’s policy settings, the stock of electric buses increases sevenfold by 2035 and that of electric trucks around thirtyfold, supported by tougher emissions Global EV Outlook 2024 Executive Summary PAGE | 15 IEA. CC BY 4.0. standards in the United States and European Union. This level of deployment could require a twentyfold jump in charging capacity by 2035 – not only in depots, but also along main transit routes to enable long- distance trucking.",

This level of deployment could require a twentyfold jump in charging capacity by 2035 – not only in depots, but also along main transit routes to enable long- distance trucking. Increasing heavy-duty charging has important implications for expanding and operating electrical grids, with opportunities for greater flexibility and renewables integration. Policy support, careful planning and c o-ordination will be essential to ensure a secure, affordable and low -emissions supply of electricity with limited strain on local grids. Global EV Outlook 2024 Electric Vehicles Initiative PAGE | 16 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electric Vehicles Initiative The Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) is a multi -governmental policy forum established in 2010 under the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). Recognising the opportunities offered by EVs, the EVI is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of EVs worldwide. To do so, it strives to better understand the policy challenges related to electric mobility, to help governments address them and to serve as a platform for knowledge-sharing among government policy makers. The EVI also facilitates exchanges between government policy makers and a variety of other partners on topics important for the transition to electric mobility, such as charging infrastructure and grid integration as well as EV battery supply chains. The International Energy Agency serves as the co -ordinator of the initiative. Governments that have been active in the EVI in the 2023- 24 period include Canada, Chile, People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Canada, China, the Netherlands and the United States are the co-leads of the initiative. The Global EV Outlook annual series is the flagship publication of the EVI. It is dedicated to tracking and monitoring the progress of electric mobility worldwide and to informing policy makers on how to best accelerate electrification of the road transport sector.

Trends in electric cars Electric car sales Nearly one in five cars sold in 2023 was electric Electric car sales neared 14 million in 2023, 95% of which were in China, Europe and the United States Almost 14 million new electric cars1 were registered globally in 2023, bringing their total number on the roads to 40 million, closely tracking the sales forecast from the 2023 edition of the Global EV Outlook (GEVO-2023). Electric car sales in 2023 were 3.5 million higher than in 2022, a 35% year-on-year increase. This is more than six times higher than in 2018, just 5 years earlier. In 2023, there were over 250 000 new registrations per week, which is more than the annual total in 2013, ten years earlier. Electric cars accounted for around 18% of all cars sold in 2023, up from 14% in 2022 and only 2% 5 years earlier, in 2018. These trends indicate that growth remains robust as electric car markets mature.",

In 2023, just under 60% of new electric car registrations were in the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), just under 25% in Europe,2 and 10% in the United States – corresponding to nearly 95% of global electric car sales combined. In these countries, electric cars account for a large share of local car markets: more than one in three new car registrations in China was electric in 2023, over one in five in Europe, and one in ten in the United States. However, sales remain limited elsewhere, even in countries with developed car markets such as Japan and India . As a result of sales concentration, the global electric car stock is also increasingly concentrated. Nevertheless, China, Europe and the United States also represent around two- thirds of total car sales and stocks, meaning that the EV transition in these markets has major repercussions in terms of global trends. In China, the number of new electric car registrations reached 8.1 million in 2023, increasing by 35% relative to 2022 . Increasing electric car sales were the main reason for growth in the overall car market, which contracted by 8% for conventional (internal combustion engine) cars but grew by 5% in total, indicating that electric car sales are continuing to perform as the market matures. The year 2023 was the first in which China’s New Energy Vehicle ( NEV)3 industry r an without support from national subsidies for EV purchases, which have facilitated expansion of the market for more than a decade.",

The year 2023 was the first in which China’s New Energy Vehicle ( NEV)3 industry r an without support from national subsidies for EV purchases, which have facilitated expansion of the market for more than a decade. Tax exemption for EV purchases and non-financial support remain in place , after an extension, as the automotive industry is seen as one of the key drivers of economic growth. Some province-led support and investment also remains in place and play s an important role in China’s EV landscape. As the market matures, the industry is entering a phase marked by increased price competition and consolidation. In addition, China exported over 4 million cars in 2023, making it the largest auto exporter in the world, among which 1.2 million were EVs. This is markedly more than the previous year – car exports were almost 65% higher than in 2022, and electric car exports were 80% higher. The main export markets for these vehicles were Europe and countries in the Asia Pacific region, such as Thailand and Australia. In the United States, new electric car registrations totalled 1.4 million in 2023, increasing by more than 40% compared to 2022. While relative annual growth in 2023 was slower than in the preceding two years, demand for electric cars and absolute growth remained strong. The revised qualifications for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, alongside electric car price cuts, meant that some popular EV models became eligible for credit in 2023. Sales of the Tesla Model Y , for example, increased 50% compared to 2022 after it became eligible for the full USD 7 500 tax credit.

As of 2024, new guidance for the tax credits means the number of eligible models has fallen to less than 30 from about 45,4 including several trim levels of the Tesla Model 3 becoming ineligible. However, in 2023 and 2024, leasing business models enable electric cars to qualify for the tax credits even if they do not fully meet the requirements, as leased cars can qualify for a less strict commercial vehicle tax credit and these tax credit savings can be passed to lease-holders.",

Such strategies have also contributed to sustained electric car roll-out. In Europe, new electric car registrations reached nearly 3.2 million in 2023, increasing by almost 20% relative to 2022. In the European Union, sales amounted to 2.4 million, with similar growth rates. As in China, the high rates of electric car sales seen in Europe suggest that growth remains robust as markets mature, and several European countries reached important milestones in 2023. Germany, for example, became the third country after China and the United States to record half a million new battery electric car registrations in a single year, with 18% of car sales being battery electric (and another 6% plug-in hybrid). However, the phase-out of several purchase subsidies in Germany slowed overall EV sales growth. At the start of 2023, PHEV subsidies were phased out, resulting in lower PHEV sales compared to 2022, and in December 2023, all EV subsidies ended after a ruling on the Climate and Transformation Fund. In Germany, the sales share for electric cars fell from 30% in 2022 to 25% in 2023. This had an impact on the overall electric car sales share in the region. In the rest of Europe, however, electric car sales and their sales share increased. Around 25% of all cars sold in France and the United Kingdom were electric, 30% in the Netherlands, and 60% in Sweden. In Norway, sales shares increased slightly despite the overall market contracting, and its sales share remains the highest in Europe, at almost 95%. 4 Based on model trim eligibility from the US government website as of 31 March 2024.

For the first time, China was the front-runner in fuel cell electric vehicle deployment in 2023 In 2023, the global stock of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) increased by around 20% compared to 2022, reaching 87 600 by the end of the year. Of the 15 400 new FCEVs hitting the roads in 2023, about half were cars, around one- quarter were medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and almost 10% were buses. The fastest-growing segment was light commercial vehicles, for which the stock approximately tripled in 2023, mainly thanks to sales in China. The stock of heavy- duty fuel cell trucks doubled. At the end of 2023, Asia accounted for over 70% of FCEVs worldwide, followed by North America with 20% and Europe with less than 10%. Korea is the leading country in terms of FCEV stock, accounting for almost 40% of all FCEVs, mainly due to its large passenger car fleet (exceeding 33 000). The United States is home to 18 200 FCEVs, almost all of which are fuel cell cars. The United States has the second-largest fuel cell car stock worldwide, with around 30% of the global stock. However, in 2023, China became home to the second -largest FCEV fleet, overtaking the United States, and constituting over 20% of the total FCEV stock. Despite having fewer than 800 fuel cell cars, China has the largest fleet across all other segments. It accounts for around 95% of medium- and heavy-duty fuel cell trucks, 90% of fuel cell LCVs, and just over 80% of fuel cell buses. However, China is still some distance – less than halfway – from meeting the government’s aim of reaching 50 000 FCEVs by 2025 .

Sales in emerging markets are increasing, albeit from a low base, led by Southeast Asia and Brazil Electric car sales continued to increase in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) outside China in 2023, but they remained low overall. In many cases , personal c ars are not the most common means of passenger transport, especially compared with shared vans and minibuses, or two- and three- wheelers (2/3Ws), which are more prevalent and more often electrified, given their relative accessibility and affordability . The electrification of 2/3Ws and public or shared mobility will be key to achieve emissions reductions in such cases (see later sections in this report). While switching from internal combustion engine (ICE) to electric cars is important, the effect on overall emissions differs depending on the mode of transport that is displaced. R eplacing 2/3Ws, public and shared mobility or more active forms of transport with personal cars may not be desirable in all cases. In India, electric car registrations were up 70% year-on-year to 80 000, compared to a growth rate of under 10% for total car sales. Around 2% of all cars sold were electric. Purchase incentives under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME II) scheme, supply-side incentives under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, tax benefits and the Go Electric campaign have all contributed to fostering demand in recent years . A number of new models also became popular in 2023, such as Mahindra’s XUV400, MG’s Comet, Citroën’s e- C3, BYD’s Yuan Plus, and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5, driving up growth compared to 2022. However, if the forthcoming FAME III scheme includes a subsidy reduction, as has been speculated in line with lower subsidy levels in the 2024 budget, future growth could be affected. Local carmakers have thus far maintained a strong foothold in the market, supported by advantageous import tariffs, and account for 80% of electric car sales in cumulative terms since 2010, led by Tata (70%) and Mahindra (10%). In Thailand, electric car registrations more than quadrupled year-on-year to nearly 90 000, reaching a notable 10% sales share – comparable to the share in the United States. This is all the more impressive given that overall car sales in the country decreased from 2022 to 2023. New subsidies, including for domestic battery manufacturing, and lower import and excise taxes, combined with the growing presence of Chinese carmakers, have contributed to rapidly increasing sales.",

The company went public in 2023, far exceeding expectations with a debut market valuation of around USD 85 billion, well beyond General Motors ( GM) (USD 46 billion), Ford (USD 48 billion) or BMW (USD 68 billion), before it settled back down around USD 20 billion by the end of the year. VinFast also looks to enter regional markets, such as India and the Philippines. In Malaysia, electric car registrations more than tripled to 10 000, supported by tax breaks and import duty exemptions , as well as an acceleration in charging infrastructure roll -out. In 2023, Mercedes -Benz marketed the first domestically assembled EV, and both BYD and Tesla also entered the market. In Latin America, electric car sales reached almost 90 000 in 2023, with markets in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico leading the region. In Brazil, electric car registrations nearly tripled year-on-year to more than 50 000, a market share of 3%. Growth in Brazil was underpinned by the entry of Chinese carmakers, such as BYD with its Song and Dolphin models, Great Wall with its H6, and Chery with its Tiggo 8, which immediately ranked among the best-selling models in 2023. Road transport electrification in Brazil could bring significant climate benefits given the largely low-emissions power mix , as well as reducing local air pollution. However, EV adoption has been slow thus far, given the national prioritisation of ethanol-based fuels since the late 1970s as a strategy to maintain energy security in the face of oil shocks . Today, biofuels are important alternative fuels available at competitive cost and aligned with the existing refuelling infrastructure. Brazil remains the world’s largest producer of sugar cane, and its agribusiness represents about one-fourth of GDP. At the end of 2023, Brazil launched the Green Mobility and Innovation Programme , which provides tax incentives for companies to develop and manufacture low-emissions road transport technology, aggregating to more than BRA 19 billion (Brazilian reals) (USD 3.8 billion) over the 2024-2028 period. Several major carmakers already in Brazil are developing hybrid ethanol-electric models as a result. China’s BYD and Great Wall are also planning to start domestic manufacturing, counting on local battery metal deposits, and plan to sell both fully electric and hybrid ethanol -electric models. BYD is investing over USD 600 million in its electric car plant in Brazil – its first outside Asia – for an annual capacity of 150 000 vehicles.

In Mexico, electric car registrations were up 80% year-on-year to 15 000, a market share just above 1%. Given its proximity to the United States, Mexico’s automotive market is already well integrated with North American partners, and benefits from advantageous trade agreements, large existing manufacturing capacity, and eligibility for subsidies under the IRA. As a result, local EV supply chains are developing quickly, with expectations that this will spill over into domestic markets. Tesla, Ford, Stellantis, BMW, GM, Volkswagen ( VW) and Audi have all either started manufacturing or announced plans to manufacture EVs in Mexico. Chinese carmakers such as BYD, Chery and SAIC are also considering expanding to Mexico. Elsewhere in the region, Colombia and Costa Rica are seeing increasing electric car sales, with around 6 000 and 5 000 in 2023, respectively, but sales remain limited in other Central and South American countries. Throughout Africa, Eurasia and the Middle East, electric cars are still rare , accounting for less than 1% of total car sales. However, as Chinese carmakers look for opportunities abroad, new models – including those produced domestically – could boost EV sales. For example, in Uzbekistan , BYD set up a joint venture with UzAuto Motors in 2023 to produce 50 000 electric cars annually, and Chery International established a partnership with ADM Jizzakh. This partnership has already led to a steep increase in electric car sales in Uzbekistan, reaching around 10 000 in 2023. In the Middle East , Jordan boasts the highest electric car sales share, at more than 45%, supported by much lower import duties relative to ICE cars, followed by the United Arab Emirates, with 13%. Policy support in Indonesia is attracting international majors and boosting electric car sales Until 2019, annual electric car sales in Indonesia were below 100, increasing tenfold to under 1 000 in 2020-2021. In 2022, annual sales jumped to over 10 000, and in 2023 they reached 17 000, supported by purchase incentives. Electric cars benefit from a reduced Value-Added Tax of 1% (compared to 11% for conventional cars), are exempt from the luxury tax that applies to many vehicles, and from import tax, and a re eligible for regional tax reductions. Increasing model availability is also helping boost sales. As in many other countries in the region, foreign carmakers – especially Chinese – are increasingly entering the market. Chinese companies accounted for 75% of electric car sales in 2022, and 45% in 2023. For example, Wuling ’s Air EV, which is competitively Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 26 IEA.

CC BY 4.0. priced relative to conventional cars, at around IDR 220 million (Indonesian rupiah) (USD 14 000), has become a best -seller. Other best-selling models, such as Toyota’s Kijang at IDR 420 million (USD 25 000) or Hyundai’s Ioniq at IDR 670 million (USD 42 000), remain more expensive than conventional equivalents, appealing to a pool of wealthier early adopters. In 2023, in order to promote domestic manufacturing, the government of Indonesia limited purchase incentives to models meeting local content requirements of 40%. As of 2023, only two models (Hyundai’s Ioniq and Wuling’s Air) met this criteria, which, alongside rising interest rates for credit-backed car purchases, may have hampered growth. In 2023, sales fell short of the government ’s target of subsidising 36 000 electric cars, and at the end of the year , local content requirements were relaxed until 2026. As a result, international companies are now setting up manufacturing facilities in the country , such as BYD and VinFast, both expected in 2024 . Available BYD models will be priced at IDR 400 million (USD 25 000), and VinFast at IDR 250 million (USD 16 000). BYD plans to invest USD 1.3 billion in manufacturing facilities with an annual capacity of 150 000 cars, and VinFast to assemble 50 000 cars a year. Electric buses and 2/3Ws have not yet experienced the same success. In 2023, Indonesia’s 100 electric buses were primarily concentrated in Jakarta, and imported from China; the provincial government aims to add another 200 in 2024. Electric 2/3W sales reached about 11 500 in 2023, well below the government target to subsidise 200 000. Factors limiting 2/3W uptake include low ranges and lack of charging points to enable interurban journeys. Looking forward, Indonesia aims to have 2 million electric cars and 13 million electric 2/3Ws on the road by 2030. The new capital city will mandate EVs as the main means of transportation. Battery manufacturing capacity is also ramping up, capitalising on rich nickel reserves. In 2024, Indonesia announced a joint venture between Hyundai, LG Energy Solution, and Indonesia Battery Corporation, as part of a IDR 140 trillion (USD 9.8 billion) public support package. Strong electric car sales in the first quarter of 2024 surpass the annual total from just four years ago Electric car sales remained strong in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing those of the same period in 2023 by around 25% to reach more than 3 million.

Source: IEA analysis based on data from on EV Volumes, China Passenger Car Association and the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. From January to March of this year, nearly 1.9 million electric cars were sold in China, marking an almost 35% increase compared to sales in the first quarter of 2023. In March, NEV sales in China surpassed a share of 40% in overall car sales for the first time , according to retail sales reported by the China Passenger Car Association. As witnessed in 2023, sales of plug-in hybrid electric cars are growing faster than sales of pure battery electric cars. Plug- in hybrid electric car sales in the first quarter increased by around 75% year-on-year in China, compared to just 15% for battery electric car sales, though the former started from a lower base. In Europe, the first quarter of 2024 saw year -on-year growth of over 5%, slightly above the growth in overall car sales and thereby stabilising the EV sales share at a similar level as last year. Electric car sales growth was particularly high in Belgium, where around 60 000 electric cars were sold, almost 35% more than the year before. However, Belgium represents less than 5% of total European car sales. In the major European markets – France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom (together representing about 60% of European car sales) – growth in electric car sales was lower. In France, overall EV sales in the first quarter grew by about 15%, with BEV sales growth being higher than for PHEVs. While this is less than half the rate as over the same period last year, total sales were nonetheless higher and led to a slight increase in the share of EVs in tot al car sales. The United Kingdom saw similar year-on-year growth (over 15%) in EV sales as France, about the same rate as over the same period last year . In Germany, where battery electric car subsidies ended in 2023, sales of electric cars fell by almost 5% in the first quarter of 2024, mainly as a result of a 20% year-on- year decrease in March.",

CC BY 4.0. the first three months of 2024 were more than 20% lower than over the same period in 2023, with the majority of the decrease taking place in the PHEV segment. However, this trend could be reversed based on the introduction of a new incentive scheme, and if Chinese automaker Chery succeeds in appealing to Italian consumers when it enters the market later this year. In the United States, first -quarter sales reached around 350 000, almost 15% higher than over the same period the year before. As in other major markets, the sales growth of PHEVs was even higher, at 50%. While the BEV sales share in the United States appears to have fallen somewhat over the past few months, the sales share of PHEVs has grown. In smaller EV markets, sales growth in the first months of 2024 was much higher, albeit from a low base . In January and February, electric car sales almost quadrupled in Brazil and increased more than sevenfold in Viet Nam. In India , sales increased more than 50% in the first quarter of 2024. These figures suggest that EVs are gaining momentum across diverse markets worldwide. Since 2021, first-quarter electric car sales have typically accounted for 15-20% of the total global annual sales. Based on this observed trend, coupled with policy momentum and the seasonality that EV sales typically experience, we estimate that electric car sales could reach around 17 million in 2024. This indicates robust growth for a maturing market, with 2024 sales to surpass those of 2023 by more than 20% and EVs to reach a share in total car sales of more than one-fifth.

CC BY 4.0. The majority of the additional 3 million electric car sales projected for 2024 relative to 2023 are from China. Despite the phase- out of NEV purchase subsidies last year, sales in China have remained robust, indicating that the market is maturing. With strong competition and relatively low-cost electric cars, sales are to grow by almost 25 % in 2024 compared to last year, reaching around 10 million. If confirmed, this figure will come close to the total global electric car sales in 2022. As a result, electric car sales could represent around 45% of total car sales in China over 2024. In 2024, electric car sales in the United States are projected to rise by 20% compared to the previous year, translating to almost half a million more sales, relative to 2023. Despite reporting of a rocky end to 2023 for electric cars in the United States, sales shares are projected to remain robust in 2024. Over the entire year, around one in nine cars sold are expected to be electric. Based on recent trends, and considering that tightening CO 2 targets are due to come in only in 2025, the growth in electric car sales in Europe is expected to be the lowest of the three largest markets. Sales are projected to reach around 3.5 million units in 2024, reflecting modest growth of less than 10% compared to the previous year. In the context of a generally weak outlook for passenger car sales, electric cars would still represent about one in four cars sold in Europe. Outside of the major EV markets, electric car sales are anticipated to reach the milestone of over 1 million units in 2024, marking a significant increase of over 40% compared to 2023. Recent trends showing the success of both homegrown and Chinese electric carmakers in Southeast Asia underscore that the region is set to make a strong contribution to the sales of emerging EV markets (see the section on Trends in the electric vehicle industry ). Despite some uncertainty surrounding whether India’s forthcoming FAME III scheme will include subsidies for electric cars, we expect sales in India to remain robust, and to experience around 50% growth compared to 2023. Across all regions outside the three major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to represent around 5% of total car sales in 2024, which – considering the high growth rates seen in recent years – could indicate that a tipping point towards global mass adoption is getting closer. There are of course downside risks to the 2024 outlook for electric car sales.",

There are of course downside risks to the 2024 outlook for electric car sales. Factors such as high interest rates and economic uncertainty could potentially reduce the growth of global electric car sales in 2024. Other challenges may come from the IRA res trictions on US electric car tax incentives, and the tightening of technical requirements for EVs to qualify for the purchase tax exemption in China. However, there are also upside potentials to consider. New markets may open up more rapidly than anticipated, as automakers expand their EV operations and new entrants compete for market share. This could lead to accelerated growth in electric car sales globally, surpassing the initial estimations. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 30 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electric car availability and affordability More electric models are becoming available, but the trend is towards larger ones The number of available electric car models nears 600, two- thirds of which are large vehicles and SUVs In 2023, the number of available models for electric cars increased 15% year-on- year to nearly 590, as carmakers scaled up electrification plans, seeking to appeal to a growing consumer base . Meanwhile , the number of fully ICE models (i.e. excluding hybrids) declined for the fourth consecutive year, at an average of 2%. Based on recent original equipment manufacturer ( OEM) announcements, the number of new electric car models could reach 1 000 by 2028. If all announced new electric models actually reach the market, and if the number of available ICE car models continues to decline by 2% annually, there could be as many electric as ICE car models before 2030.

CC BY 4.0. As reported in GEVO-2023, the share of small and medium electric car models is decreasing among available electric models : in 2023, two -thirds of the battery- electric models on the market were SUVs,5 pick-up trucks or large cars. Just 25% of battery electric car sales in the United States were for small and medium models, compared to 40% in Europe and 50% in China. Electric cars are following the same trend as conventional cars, and getting bigger on average. In 2023, SUVs, pick-up trucks and large models accounted for 65% of total ICE car sales worldwide, and more than 80% in the United States, 60% in China and 50% in Europe. Several factors underpin the increase in the share of large models. Since the 2010s, conventional SUVs in the United States have benefited from less stringent tailpipe emissions rules than smaller models, creating an incentive for carmakers to market more vehicles in that segment . Similarly, in the European Union, CO 2 targets for passenger cars have included a compromise on weight, allowing CO2 leeway f or heavier vehicles in some cases. Larger vehicles also mean larger margins for carmakers. Given that incumbent carmakers are not yet making a profit on their EV offer in many cases, focusing on larger models enables them to increase their margins. Under the US IRA, electric SUVs can qualify for tax credits as long as they are priced under USD 80 000, whereas the limit stands at USD 55 000 for a sedan, creating an incentive to market SUVs if a greater margin can be gathered. On the demand side, there is now strong willingness to pay for SUVs or large models. Consumers are typically interested in longer -range and larger cars for their primary vehicles, even though small models are more suited to urban use. Higher marketing spend on SUVs compared to smaller models can also have an impact on consumer choices. The progressive shift towards ICE SUVs has been dramatically limiting fuel savings. Over the 2010- 2022 period, without the shift to SUVs, energy use per kilometre could have fallen at an average annual rate 30% higher than the actual rate.",

Over the 2010- 2022 period, without the shift to SUVs, energy use per kilometre could have fallen at an average annual rate 30% higher than the actual rate. Switching to electric in the SUV and larger car segments can therefore achieve immediate and significant CO 2 emissions reductions, and electrification also brings considerable benefits in terms of reducing air pollution and non-tailpipe emissions, especially in urban settings. In 2023, if all ICE and HEV sales of SUVs had instead been BEV, around 770 Mt CO2 could have been avoided globally over the cars’ lifetimes (see section 10 on lifecycle analysis). This is equivalent to the total road emissions of China in 2023. 5 SUVs may be defined differently across regions, but broadly refer to vehicles that incorporate features commonly found in off-road vehicles (e.g. four -wheel drive, higher ground clearance, larger cargo area). In this report, small and large SUVs both count as SUVs. Crossovers are counted as SUVs if they feature an SUV body type; otherwise they are categorised as medium-sized vehicles.

Nevertheless, from a policy perspective, it is critical to mitigate the negative spillovers associated with an increase in larger electric cars in the fleet. Larger electric car models have a significant impact on battery supply chains and critical mineral demand. In 2023, the sales-weighted average battery electric SUV in Europe had a battery almost twice as large as the one in the average small electric car, with a proportionate impact on critical mineral needs. Of course, the range of small cars is typically shorter than SUVs and large cars (see later section on ranges). However, when comparing electric SUVs and medium-sized electric cars, which in 2023 offered a similar range, the SUV battery was still 25% larger. This means that if all electric SUVs sold in 2023 had instead been medium-sized cars, around 60 GWh of battery equivalent could have been avoided globally, with limited impact on range . Accounting for the different chemistries used in China, Europe, and the United States, this would be equivalent to almost 6 000 tonnes of lithium, 30 000 tonnes of nickel, almost 7 000 tonnes of cobalt, and over 8 000 tonnes of manganese.",

Only 25% of the 400+ launches expected over the 2024 -2028 period are small and medium models, which represents a smaller share of available models than in 2023.

This is encouraging for consumers looking to purchase an electric car for longer journeys rather than urban use. Since 2020, growth in the average range of vehicles has been slower than over the 2015- 2020 period. This could result from a number of factors, including fluctuating battery prices , carmakers’ attempts to limit additional costs as competition intensifies , and technical constraints (e.g. energy density, battery size). It could also reflect that beyond a certain range at which most driving needs are met, consumers’ willingness to pay for a marginal increase in battery size and range is limited . Looking forward, however, the average range could start increasing again as novel battery technologies mature and prices fall. More affordable electric cars are needed to reach a mass-market tipping point An equitable and inclusive transition to electric mobility, both within countries and at the global level, hinges on the successful launch of affordable EVs ( including but not limited to electric cars). In this section, we use historic sales and price data for electric and ICE models around the world to examine the total cost of owning an electric car, price trends over time, and the remaining electric premium, by country and vehicle size.7 Specific models are used for illustration. Total cost of ownership Car purchase decisions typically involve consideration of retail price and available subsidies as well as lifetime operating costs, such as fuel costs, insurance, maintenance and depreciation, which together make up the total cost of ownership (TCO). Reaching TCO parity between electric and ICE cars creates important financial incentives to make the switch . This sec tion examines the different components of the TCO, by region and car size. In 2023, upfront retail prices for electric cars were generally higher than for their ICE equivalents , which increased their TCO in relative term s.",

In 2023, upfront retail prices for electric cars were generally higher than for their ICE equivalents , which increased their TCO in relative term s. On the upside, higher fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs enable fuel cost savings for electric cars, lowering their TCO. This is especially true in periods when fuel prices are high, in places where electricity prices are not too closely correlated to fossil 7 Price data points collected from various data providers and ad-hoc sources cover 65-95% of both electric and ICE car sales globally. By “price”, we refer to the advertised price that the customer pays for the acquisition of the vehicle only, including legally required acquisition taxes (e.g. including Value-Added Tax and registration taxes but excluding consumer tax credits). Prices reflect not only the materials, components and manufacturing costs, but also the costs related to sales and marketing, administration, R&D and the profit margin. In the case of a small electric car in Europe, for example, these mark -up costs can account for around 40% of the final pre-tax price. They account for an even greater share of the final pre-tax price when consumers purchase additional options, or opt for larger models, for which margins can be higher. The price for the same model may differ across countries or regions (e.g. in 2023, a VW ID.3 could be purchased in China at half its price in Europe).

Depreciation is also a major factor in determining TCO: As a car ages, it loses value, and depreciation for electric cars tends to be faster than for ICE equivalents, further increasing their TCO . Accelerated depreciation could, however, prove beneficial for the development of second-hand markets. However, the trend towards faster depreciation for electric vehicles might be reversed for multiple reasons. Firstly, consumers are gaining more confidence in electric battery lifetimes, thereby increasing the resale value of EVs. Secondly, strong demand and the positive brand image of some BEV models can mean they hold their value longer, as shown by Tesla models depreciating more slowly than the average petrol car in the United States. Finally, increasing fuel prices in some regions, the roll -out of low- emissions zones that restrict access for the most polluting vehicles, and taxes and parking fees specifically targeted at ICE vehicles could mean they experience faster depreciation rates than EVs in the future. In light of these two possible opposing depreciation trends, the same fixed annual depreciation rate for both BEVs and ICE vehicles has been applied in the following cost of ownership analysis.

In light of these two possible opposing depreciation trends, the same fixed annual depreciation rate for both BEVs and ICE vehicles has been applied in the following cost of ownership analysis. Subsidies help lower the TCO of electric cars relative to ICE equivalents in multiple ways. A purchase subsidy lowers the original retail price, thereby lowering capital depreciation over time, and a lower retail price implies lower financing costs through cumulative interest. Subsidies can significantly reduce the number of years required to reach TCO parity between electric and ICE equivalents. As of 2022, we estimate that TCO parity could be reached in most cases in under 7 years in the three major EV markets, with significant variations across different car sizes. In comparison, for models purchased at 2018 prices, TCO parity was much harder to achieve. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 37 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. In Germany, for example, we estimate that the sales-weighted average price of a medium-sized battery electric car in 2022 was 10- 20% more expensive than its ICE equivalent, but 10 -20% cheaper in cumulative costs of ownership after 5 years, thanks to fuel and maintenance costs savings. In the case of an electric SUV, we estimate that the average annual operating cost savings would amount to USD 1 800 when compared to the equivalent conventional SUV over a period of 10 years. In the United States, despite lower fuel prices with respect to electricity, the higher average annual mileage results in savings that are close to Germany at USD 1 600 per year. In China, lower annual distance driven reduces fuel cost savings potential, but the very low price of electricity enables savings of about USD 1 000 per year. These figures provide an indication of how long it would take to recoup the initial purchase price gap between a BEV and its equivalent ICEV through operating cost savings. In EMDEs, some electric cars can also be cheaper than ICE equivalents over their lifetime. This is true in India, for example, although it depends on the financing instrument. Access to finance is typically much more challenging in EMDEs due to higher interest rates and the more limited availability of cheap capital. Passenger cars have also a significantly lower market penetration in the first place, and many car purchases are made in second-hand markets. Later sections of this report look at markets for used electric cars, as well as the TCO for electric and conventional 2/3Ws in EMDEs, where they are far more widespread than cars as a means of road transport.",

CC BY 4.0. Upfront retail price parity Achieving price parity between electric and ICE cars will be an important tipping point. Even when the TCO for electric cars is advantageous, the upfront retail price plays a decisive role, and mass-market consumers are typically more sensitive to price premiums than wealthier buyers . This holds true not only in emerging and developing economies, which have comparatively high costs of capital and comparatively low household and business incomes , but also in advanced economies. In the United States, for example, surveys suggest affordability was the top concern for consumers considering EV adoption in 2023. Other estimates show that even among SUV and pick -up truck consumers, only 50% would be willing to purchase one above USD 50 000. In this section, we examine historic price trends for electric and ICE cars over the 2018-2022 period, by country and car size, and for best-selling models in 2023. Electric cars are generally getting cheaper as battery prices drop, competition intensifies, and carmakers achieve economies of scale. In most cases, however, they remain on average more expensive than ICE equivalents. In some cases, after adjusting for inflation, their price stagnated or even moderately increased between 2018 and 2022. Larger batteries for longer ranges increase car prices, and so too do the additional options, equipment, digital technology and luxury features that are often marketed on top of the base model. A disproportionate focus on larger, premium models is pushing up the average price, which – added to the lack of available models in second-hand markets (see below) – limits potential to reach mass -market consumers.",

Importantly, geopolitical tension, trade and supply chain disruptions, increasing battery prices in 2022 relative to 2021, and rising inflation, have also significantly affected the potential for further cost declines. Competition can also play an important role in bringing down electric car prices. Intensifying competition leads carmakers to cut prices to the minimum profit margin they can sustain, and – if needed – to do so more quickly than battery and production costs decline. For example, between mid-2022 and early-2024, Tesla cut the price of its Model Y from between USD 65 000 and USD 70 000 to between USD 45 000 and USD 55 000 in the United States. Battery prices for such a model dropped by only USD 3 000 over the same period in the United States, suggesting that a profit margin may still be made at a lower price. Similarly, in China, the price of the Base Model Y dropped from CNY 320 000 (Yuan renminbi) (USD 47 000) to CNY 250 000 (USD 38 000), while the corresponding battery price fell by only USD 1 000. Conversely, in cases where electric models remain niche or aimed at wealthier, less price-sensitive early adopters, their price may not fall as quickly as battery prices, if carmakers can sustain greater margins.

It was priced around CNY 40 000, weighing under 700 kg for a 170-km range. In 2023, however, it was overtaken by Tesla models, among other larger models, as new consumers seek longer ranges and higher -end options and digital equipment.

Average price parity between electric and conventional SUVs could be reached by 2030 , but it may only be reached later for small and medium cars, given their lower availability and popularity. Smaller, cheaper electric models have further to go to reach price parity in the United States. We estimate that in 2022, only about 5% of the electric cars sold in the United States were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent. In 2023, the cheapest electric cars were priced around USD 30 000 (e.g. Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf, Mini Cooper SE). To compare, best -selling small ICE options cost under USD 20 000 (e.g. Kia Rio, Mitsubishi Mirage), and many best -selling medium ICE options between USD 20 000 and USD 25 000 (e.g. Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Kia Forte, Hyundai Avante, Nissan Sentra). Around 25 new all- electric car models are expected in 2024, but only 5 of them are expected below USD 50 000, and none under the USD 30 000 mark. Considering all the electric models expected to be available in 2024, about 75% are priced above USD 50 000, and fewer than 10 under USD 40 000, even after taking into account the USD 7 500 tax credit under the IRA for eligible cars as of February 2024.

In December 2023, GM stopped production of its best-selling electric car, the Bolt, announcing it would introduce a new version in 2025. The Nissan Leaf (40 kWh) therefore remains the cheapest available electric car in 2024, at just under USD 30 000, but is not yet eligible for IRA tax credits. Ford announced in 2024 that it would move away from large and expensive electric cars as a way to convince more consumers to switch to electric, at the same time as increasing output of ICE models to help finance a transition to electric mobility. In 2024, Tesla announced it would start producing a next -generation, compact and affordable electric car in June 2025, but the company had already announced in 2020 that it would deliver a USD 25 000 model within 3 years. Some micro urban electric cars are already available between USD 5 000 and USD 20 000 (e.g. Arcimoto FUV, Nimbus One), but they are rare. In theory, such models could cover many use cases, since 80% of car journeys in the United States are under 10 miles. Europe Pricing trends differ across European countries, and typically vary by segment. In Norway, after taking into account the EV sales tax exemption, electric cars are already cheaper than ICE equivalents across all segments. In 2022, we estimate that the electric premium stood around - 15%, and even -30% for medium -sized cars. Five years earlier, in 2018, the overall electric premium was less advantageous, at around - 5%. The progressive reintroduction of sales taxes on electric cars may change these estimates for 2023 onwards. Germany’s electric premium ranks among the lowest in the European Union. Although the sales-weighted average electric premium increased slightly between 2018 and 2022, it stood at 15% in 2022. It is particularly low for medium-sized cars (10-15%) and SUVs (20%), but remains higher than 50% for small models. In the case of medium cars, the sales-weighted average electric premium was as low as EUR 5 000 in 2022. We estimate that in 2022, over 40% of the medium electric cars sold in Germany were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent. Looking at total sales, over 25% of the electric cars sold in 2022 were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent. In 2023, the cheapest models among the best -selling medium electric cars were priced between EUR 22 000 and EUR 35 000 (e.g. MG MG4, Dacia Spring, Renault Megane), far cheaper than the three front -runners priced above EUR 45 000 ( VW ID.3, Cupra Born, and Tesla Model 3). To compare, best-selling ICE cars in the medium segment were also priced between EUR 30 000 and EUR 45 000 (e.g. VW Golf, VW Passat Santana, Skoda Octavia Laura, Audi A3, Audi A4).",

Notes: “BEV” = battery electric vehicle; “ICEV” = internal combustion engine vehicle; “USA” = United States; SUV = sports utility vehicle. Car prices are for base models with no additional options or equipment. For BEV sales, the sample covers price data for 60-90% in China, 75-100% in the United States, and 85-95% in Europe, depending on the segment. For ICEV sales, the sample covers price data for the top 40- 55% of total sales. Annual income values are used. Median household income values are around USD 14 000 in China, USD 43 000 in Europe (data for Germany), and USD 80 000 in the United States.

In France, the sales-weighted average electric premium stagnated between 2018 and 2022. The average price of ICE cars also increased over the same period, though more moderately than that of electric models. Despite a drop in the price of electric SUVs, which stood at a 30% premium over ICE equivalents in 2022, the former do not account for a high enough share of total electric car sales to drive down the overall average. The electric premium for small and medium cars remains around 40-50%. These trends mirror those of some of the best-selling models. For example, when adjusting prices for inflation, the small Renault Zoe was sold at the same price on average in 2022-2023 as in 2018-2019, or EUR 30 000 (USD 32 000). It could be found for sale at as low as EUR 25 000 in 2015-2016. The earlier models, in 2015, had a battery size of around 20 kWh, which increased to around 40 kWh in 2018-2019 and 50 kWh in newer models in 2022- 2023. Yet European battery prices fell more quickly than the battery size increased over the same period, indicating that battery size alone does not explain car price dynamics. In 2023, the cheapest electric cars in France were priced between EUR 22 000 and EUR 30 000 (e.g.",

Since mid -2024, subsidies of up to EUR 4 000 can be granted for electric cars priced under EUR 47 000, with an additional subsidy of up to EUR 3 000 for lower-income households. In the United Kingdom, the sales -weighted average electric premium shrank between 2018 and 2022 , thanks to a drop in prices for electric SUVs, as in the United States. Nonetheless, electric SUVs still stood at a 45% premium over ICE equivalents in 2022, which is similar to the premium for small models but far higher than for medium cars (20%). In 2023 , the cheapest electric cars in the United Kingdom were priced from GBP 27 000 to GBP 30 000 ( USD 33 000 to 37 000) (e.g. MG MG4, Fiat 500, Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe), with the exception of the Smart EQ Fortwo, priced at GBP 21 000. To compare, best -selling small ICE options could be found from GBP 10 000 to 17 000 (e.g. Peugeot 208, Fiat 500, Dacia Sandero) and medium options below GBP 25 000 (e.g. Ford Puma). Since July 2022, there has been no subsidy f or the purchase of electric passenger cars . Elsewhere in Europe, electric cars remain typically much more expensive than ICE equivalents. In Poland, for example, just a few electric car models could be found at prices competitive with ICE cars in 2023, under the PLN 150 000 (Polish zloty) (EUR 35 000) mark. Over 70% of electric car sales in 2023 were for SUVs, or large or more luxurious models, compared to less than 60% for ICE cars. In 2023, there were several announcements by European OEMs for smaller models priced under EUR 25 000 in the near-term (e.g. Renault R5, Citroën e-C3, Fiat e- Panda, VW ID.2all). There is also some appetite for urban microcars (i.e. L6-L7 category), learning from the success of China’s Wuling. Miniature models bring important benefits if they displace conventional models, helping reduce battery and critical mineral demand. Their prices are often below USD 5 000 (e.g.",

Miniature models bring important benefits if they displace conventional models, helping reduce battery and critical mineral demand. Their prices are often below USD 5 000 (e.g. Microlino, Fiat Topolino, Citroën Ami, Silence S04, Birò B2211). In Europe and the United States, electric car prices are expected to come down as a result of falling battery prices, more efficient manufacturing, and competition. Independent analyses suggest that price parity between some electric and ICE car models in certain segments could be reached over the 2025 -2028 period, for example for small electric cars in Europe in 2025 or soon after . However, many market variables could delay price parity, such as volatile commodity prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and the ability of carmakers to yield sufficient margins from cheaper electric models. The typical rule in which economies of scale bring down costs is being complicated by numerous other market forces. These include a dynamic regulatory context , geopolitical competition, domestic content incentives, and a continually evolving technology landscape, with competing battery chemistries that each have their own economies of scale and regional specificities.

Japan Japan is a rare example of an advanced economy where small models – both for electric and ICE vehicles – appeal to a large consumer base, motivated by densely populated cities with limited parking space, and policy support. In 2023, about 60% of total ICE sales were for small models, and over half of total electric sales. Two electric cars from the smallest “Kei” category, the Nissan Sakura and Mitsubishi eK-X, accounted for nearly 50% of national electric car sales alone, and both are priced between JPY 2.3 million (Japanese yen) and JPY 3 million (USD 18 000 to USD 23 000). However, this is still more expensive than best -selling small ICE cars (e.g. Honda N Box, Daihatsu Hijet, Daihatsu Tanto, Suzuki Spacia, Daihatsu Move), priced between USD 13 000 and USD 18 000. In 2024, Nissan announced that it would aim to reach cost parity (of production, not retail price) between electric and ICE cars by 2030. Emerging market and developing economies In EMDEs, the absence of small and cheaper electric car models is a significant hindrance to wider market uptake. Many of the available car models are SUVs or large models, targeting consumers of high- end goods, and far too expensive for mass-market consumers, who often do not own a personal car in the first place (see later sections on second-hand car markets and 2/3Ws). In India, while Tata’s small Tiago/Tigor models , which are priced between USD 10 000 and USD 15 000, accounted for about 20% of total electric car sales in 2023, the average best-selling small ICE car is priced around USD 7 000. Large models and SUVs accounted for over 65% of total electric car sales. While BYD announced in 2023 the goal of accounting for 40% of India’s EV market by 2030, all of its models available in India cost more than INR 3 million (Indian rupees) (USD 37 000), including the Seal, launched in 2024 for INR 4.1 million (USD 50 000). Similarly, SUVs and large models accounted for the majority share of electric car sales in Thailand (60%), Indonesia (55%), Malaysia (over 85%) and Viet Nam (over 95%). In Indonesia, for example, Hyundai’s Ionic 5 was the most popular electric car in 2023, priced at around USD 50 000. Looking at launch announcements, most new models expected over the 2024 -2028 period in EMDEs are SUVs or large models . However, more than 50 small and medium models could also be introduced, and the recent or forthcoming entry of Chinese carmakers suggests that cheaper models could hit the market in the coming years. In 2022-2023, Chinese carmakers accounted for 40-75% of the electric car sales in Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil, with sales jumping as cheaper Chinese models were introduced. In Thailand, for example, Hozon launched its Neta V model in 2022 priced at THB 550 000 (Thai baht) (USD 15 600), which became a best - Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 48 IEA.

Second-hand markets for electric cars are on the rise As electric vehicle markets mature, the second-hand market will become more important In the same way as for other technology products, second-hand markets for used electric cars are now emerging as newer generations of vehicles progressively become available and earlier adopters switch or upgrade. Second-hand markets are critical to foster mass-market adoption, especially if new electric cars remain expensive, and used ones become cheaper. Just as for ICE vehicles – for which buying second- hand is often the primary method of acquiring a car in both emerging and advanced economies – a similar pattern will emerge with electric vehicles.

Second-hand sales have not been included in the numbers presented in the previous section of this report , which focused on sales of new electric cars , but they are already significant. On aggregate, global second- hand electric car sales were roughly equal to new electric car sales in the United States in 2023. In the United States, used electric car sales are set to increase by 40% in 2024 relative to 2023. Of course, these volumes are dwarfed by second-hand ICE markets : 30 million in the European countries listed above combined, nearly 20 million in China, and 36 million in the United States. However, these markets have had decades to mature, indicating greater longer-term potential for used electric car markets. Used car markets already provide more affordable electric options in China, Europe and the United States Second-hand car markets are increasingly becoming a source of more affordable electric cars that can compete with used ICE equivalents.

Moreover, the average price is expected to quickly fall towards USD 25 000, the price at which used electric cars become eligible for the federal used car rebate of USD 4 000, making them directly competitive with best-selling new and used ICE options. The price of a second-hand Tesla in the United States dropped from over USD 50 000 in early 2023 to just above USD 33 000 in early 2024, making it competitive with a second-hand SUV and many new models as well (either electric or conventional).",

In Europe, second-hand battery electric cars can be found between EUR 15 000 and EUR 25 000 (USD 16 000-27 000), and second-hand plug-in hybrids around EUR 30 000 (USD 32 000). Some European countries also offer subsidies for second -hand electric cars, such as the Netherlands ( E UR 2 000), where the subsidy for new cars has been steadily declining since 2020, while that for used cars remains constant, and France (EUR 1 000). In China, used electric cars were priced around CNY 75 000 on average in 2023 (USD 11 000). In recent years, the resale value8 of electric cars has been increasing. In Europe, the resale value of battery electric cars sold after 12 months has steadily increased over the 2017-2022 period, surpassing that of all other powertrains and standing at more than 70% in mid-2022. The resale value of battery electric cars sold after 36 months stood below 40% in 2017, but has since been closing the gap with other powertrains, reaching around 55% in mid-2022. This is the result of many factors, including higher prices of new electric cars , improving technology allowing vehicles and batteries to retain greater value over time , and increasing demand for second-hand electric cars. Similar trends have been observed in China. High or low resale values have important implications for the development of second-hand electric car markets and their contributions to the transition to road transport electrification. High resale values primarily benefit consumers of new cars ( who retain more of the value of their initial purchase) , and carmakers , because many consumers are attracted by the possibility of reselling their car after a few years, thereby fostering demand for newer models. High resale values also benefit leasing companies, which seek to minimise depreciation and resell after a few years. Leasing companies have a significant impact on second- hand markets because they own large volumes of vehicles for a shorter period (under three years, compared to 3 to 5 years for a private household). Their impact on markets for new cars can also be considerable: leasing companies accounted for over 20% of new cars sold in Europe in 2022. Overall, a resale value for electric cars on par with or higher than that of ICE equivalents contributes to supporting demand for new electric cars.",

The y-axis shows the difference between the resale value of gasoline internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric cars: a positive value means that EVs will lose less value than ICEs, while a negative value indicates a loss in value.

Sources: IEA analysis based on data from Autovista for resale values in European countries and from CADA for China. International trade for used electric cars to emerging markets is expected to increase As the EV stock ages in advanced markets, it is likely that more and more used EVs will be traded internationally, assuming that global standards enable technology compatibility (e.g. for charging infrastructure). Imported used vehicles present an opportunity for consumers in EMDEs, who may not have access to new models because they are either too expensive or not marketed in their countries.

Typical trade flows include Western European Union member states to Eastern E uropean Union member states and to African countries that drive on the right-hand side; Japan to Asia and to African countries that drive on the left-hand side; and the United States to the Middle East and Central America. Used electric car exports from large EV markets have been growing in recent years. For China, this can be explained by the recent roll-back of a policy forbidding exports of used vehicles of any kind. Since 2019, as part of a pilot project, the government has granted 27 cities and provinces the right to export second-hand cars . In 2022, China exported almost 70 000 used vehicles, a significant increase on 2021, when fewer than 20 000 vehicles were exported . About 70% of these were NEVs, of which over 45% were exported to the Middle East. In 2023, the Ministry of Commerce released a draft policy on second-hand vehicle export that, once approved, will allow the export of second-hand vehicles from all regions of China. Used car exports from China are expected to increase significantly as a result. In the European Union, the number of used electric cars traded internationally is also increasing. In both 2021 and 2022, the market size grew by 70% year-on- year, reaching almost 120 000 electric cars in 2022. More than half of all trade takes place between EU member states, followed by trade with neighbouring countries such as Norway, the United Kingdom and Türkiye (accounting for 20% combined). The remainder of used EVs are exported to countries such as Mexico, Tunisia and the United States. As of 2023, the largest exporters are Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain. Last year, just over 1% of all used cars leaving Japan were electric. However these exports are growing and increased by 30% in 2023 relative to 2022, reaching 20 000 cars. The major second-hand electric car markets for Japanese vehicles are traditionally Russia and New Zealand ( over 60% combined) .",

The major second-hand electric car markets for Japanese vehicles are traditionally Russia and New Zealand ( over 60% combined) . After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, second-hand trade of conventional cars from Japan to Russia jumped sharply following a halt in operations of local OEMs in Russia, but this trade was quickly restricted by the Japanese government, thereby bringing down the price of second- hand cars in Japan. New Zealand has very few local vehicle assembly or manufacturing facilities , and for this reason many cars entering New Zealand are used imports. In 2023, nearly 20% of all electric cars that entered New Zealand were used imports, compared to 50% for the overall car market. In emerging economies, local policies play an important role in promoting or limiting trade flows for used cars. In the case of ICE vehicles, for example, some countries (e.g. Bolivia, Côte d’Ivoire, Peru) limit the maximum age of used car imports to prevent the dumping of highly polluting cars. Other countries Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 53 IEA. CC BY 4.0. (e.g. Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, India, South Africa) have banned used car imports entirely to protect their domestic manufacturing industries. Just as for ICE vehicles , policy measures can either help or hinder the import of used electric cars, such as by setting emission standards for imported used cars. Importing countries will also need to simultaneously support roll-out of charging infrastructure to avoid problems with access like those reported in Sri Lanka after an incentive scheme significantly increased imports of used EVs in 2018. The median age of vehicle imports tends to increase as the GDP per capita of a country decreases. In some African countries, the median age of imports is over 15 years. Beyond this timeframe , electric cars may require specific servicing to extend their lifetime. To support the availability of second-hand markets for electric cars, it will be important to develop strategies, technical capacity, and business models to swap very old batteries from used vehicles. Today, many countries that import ICE vehicles, including EMDEs, already have servicing capacity in place to extend the lifetimes of used ICE vehicles , but not used EVs. On the other hand, there are typically fewer parts in electric powertrains than in ICE ones, and these parts can even be more durable. B attery recycling capacity will also be needed, given that the importing country is likely to be where the imported EV eventually reaches end-of-life. Including end-of-life considerations in policy-making today can help mitigate the risk of longer-term environmental harm that could result from the accumulation of obsolete EVs and associated waste in EMDEs. Policy choices in more mature markets also have an impact on possible trade flows.",

Policy choices in more mature markets also have an impact on possible trade flows. For example, the current policy framework in the European Union for the circularity of EV batteries may prevent EVs and EV batteries from leaving the European Union, which brings energy security advantages but might limit reuse. In this regard, advanced economies and EMDEs should strengthen co-operation to facilitate second-hand trade while ensuring adequate end-of-life strategies. For example, there could be incentives or allowances associated with extended vehicle lifetimes via use in second-hand markets internationally before recycling, as long as recycling in the destination market is guaranteed, or the EV battery is returned at end of life.

Trends in other light-duty el ectric vehicles Electric two- and three-wheelers India, China and Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN) countries are the biggest two- and three-wheeler (2/3W)9 markets worldwide. In 2023, sales of 2/3Ws in these markets, including both electric and ICE powertrains, reached 19 million, 17 million and 14 million units, respectively. Indonesia, Viet Nam, the Philippines and Thailand are the biggest markets among ASEAN countries, with sales of 2/ 3Ws far outnumbering sales of LDVs, highlighting their importance in the region. Likewise, the number of 2/3W s in India is 157 per 1 000 people, compared with only 35 passenger cars. Despite having smaller 2/3W market s overall, 2/3Ws also play a critical role in Latin America and Africa for daily passenger and commercial transportation. Electrifying 2/3Ws is therefore a promising lever for decarbonising mobility and improving urban air quality in these regions. In 2023, the sales share of electric 2/3Ws was just 13% globally, while in terms of stock shares, 2/3Ws represent the most electrified road transport segment, with about 8% of 2/3Ws being electric. China sold the most electric 2/3Ws in 2023, with over 30% of the 2/3W sales being electric (decreasing from about 50% in 2022), followed by India (8%) and ASEAN countries (3%). Global sales of electric two-wheelers continue to decline due to falling sales in China, though growth in the rest of Asia is steady The global market for electric two-wheelers (2Ws) shrank 18% in 2023, continuing the downward trend of 2022, which was almost entirely due to supply chain challenges stemming from China’s pandemic-related restrictions. The decline at the global level was largely driv en by a 25% drop in China, which continues to command the vast majority of global electric 2W sales. The Chinese electric 2W market downturn could be ex plained by the continuing supply chain disruptions related to 2022 zero-Covid policies.",

Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in other light-duty vehicles PAGE | 55 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The fall in global electric 2W sales masks steady growth in the expanding Indian market and in some ASEAN countries. However, they are still dwarfed by China, which accounted for 78% of global sales, with nearly 6 million electric 2Ws sold in 2023, compared to 880 000 in India and 380 000 in ASEAN countries. In India – the second-largest electric 2W market globally – 2023 sales grew by 40% compared to 2022. The Indian electric 2W market is dominated by the five largest domestic manufacturers (Ola Electric, TVS Motor, Ather , Bajaj and Ampere), which accounted for more than 75% of sales. The rapid growth seen in India is the result of strong policy support for EV deployment, such as the FAME II measure, which was first introduced in 2019 as a three-year purchase incentive policy. FAME II came to an end on 31 March 2024, and will initially be replaced by a new four-month subsidy extension scheme called the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS), announced in March 2024 , which outlays over INR 4.9 billion (Indian rupees) (almost USD 60 million) to subsidise electric 2/3W purchases. The EMPS aims to support the roll-out of 372 000 additional electric 2/3Ws equipped with Li-ion batteries, bridging the gap between the FAME II scheme and potential future EV subsidies. Other policies such as the supply -side incentives under the PLI scheme, Goods and Service Tax (GST) and Regional Transport Office (RTO) tax rebates, along with India’s Go Electric campaign, have all helped bolster electric 2W uptake. As an i llustration of the effect of th e latest subsidy scheme s, in 2023 , the sales- weighted average price of an electric 2W – after subsidies and tax rebates – was over 15% lower than its ICE equivalent, despite the upfront purchase price remaining around 30% higher on average.

An electric 2W purchased in 2024 (assuming sa les-weighted average prices from 2023) after 5 years of ownership would be more than 40% cheaper than its ICE equivalent over the same period (see figure below), despite the EMPS scheme offering reduced subsidies compared to FAME II. Although sales decreased to 250 000 units in 2023, Viet Nam remains the most dynamic electric 2W market amongst ASEAN countries, with a 9% share of 2W sales. ASEAN countries have the specificity of having higher share of scooters relative to other types of 2W, along with a high share of models equipped with lead-acid batteries, which accounted for 68% of electric 2W sales in 2020. The Vietnamese electric 2W market is dominated by a handful of home-grown manufacturers (such as VinFast, Pega and Dibao), whose overall manufacturing production capacity exceeds the local domestic sales, thus giving them the capacity to export to other ASEAN country markets. Elsewhere, Indonesia is aiming to increase its domestic electric motorbike manufacturing, allocating USD 455 million in subsidies to reach 800 000 new electric motorcycle sales, along with the conversion of 200 000 conventional motorcycles.

The market is highly concentrated, with China and India together accounting for more than 95% of all electric and 80% of conventional 3W sales. India overtook China in 2023 to become the biggest market for electric 3Ws , with over 580 000 sales. India saw its sales increase by 65% with respect to 2022, thanks to government financial incentives and resulting reductions in the cost of ownership of electric 3Ws. Sales in China declined 8% in 2023, to 320 000, making the country the second-largest electric 3W market.",

The Chinese market continues to have a high share of lead-acid batteries in sales, despite government efforts to ban this technology in low- speed EVs and encourage a transition towards Li -ion technology , motivated by environmental concerns associated with the afterlife of lead- acid batteries when not recycled properly. Due to their low upfront purchase price, lead- acid battery powered electric 3Ws remain a widespread transport technology across India and rural China. In India, estimates of their market share range from 55% to 98%. However, Li-ion batteries are expected to continue gaining ground in the Indian 3W market following the introduction of the 2024 EMPS subsidy scheme, which specifically aims to reduce the purchase price of models equipped with advanced battery chemistries. In 2023 in India, despite the upfront price being 55% higher than for its gasoline equivalent, the average electric 3W model (auto-rickshaw) is more than 50 % cheaper to own after 8 years of service, and even without subsidies is over 40% cheaper (see figure above). Even when considering the most cost- effective ICE 3W running on natural gas, the electric model achieves TCO parity as soon as 2 years after purchase, and works out about 40% cheaper over an 8-year lifetime. However, subsidies still play a n important role, as without them , the TCO breakeven point is only reached after 4 years. Electric light commercial vehicles One in twenty-five light commercial vehicles sold in 2023 was electric, following the path set by passenger cars The market for electric light commercial vehicles (LCVs) continued to increase in 2023. Global electric LCV sales grew by more than 50%, and the sales share grew to just under 5%. Two of the biggest electric LCV markets, China and Europe, saw a large increase in sales in 2023, as part of a broader trend of increasing LCV sales – both electric and ICE . In China, electric LCV sale s exceeded 240 000, and in Europe, the electric LCV market leapt by 60% to reach almost 150 000.

In China, electric LCV sale s exceeded 240 000, and in Europe, the electric LCV market leapt by 60% to reach almost 150 000. As the electric LCV market matures, several OEMs have announced new electric models and new partnerships . Some of these new models are designed specifically for niche commercial activities, such as the B-ON Pelkan electric delivery van. In a partnership with Uber, Kia announced a modular van design with a body that can be swapped from shuttling to last -mile delivery depending on activity. The average range of new LCVs increased by 55% between 2015 and 2023. For example, the two most popular electric LCV models in 2015 (Nissan e-NV200 and Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in other light-duty vehicles PAGE | 59 IEA. CC BY 4.0. the Renault Kangoo BEV) had a range of around 170 km . This compares to a much longer range – between 210 and 260 km – demonstrated by two very popular models (Hyundai Porter and Ford E- Transit) in 2023. Despite this increase, companies expanding their electric fleets have called for improvements in the accuracy of range labelling. Korea is the only country in which the penetration of electric LCVs is moving faster than electric passenger cars. In Korea, the Hyundai Porter and the Kia Bongo are the only electric LCV models sold. Both are produced by local manufacturers, and seem particularly suited for the Korean light freight market, which is characterised by shorter distances. These models are also favourably priced compared to ICE equivalents: The K ia Bongo 3 EV , for example , sells for around USD 25 000, including a subsidy of USD 7 700.

Several European countries (such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland) and China achieved sales shares above 50% in 2023, and more than one -fifth of bus sales were electric in Canada, Chile, Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Sweden. Globally, almost 50 000 electric buses were sold in 2023, equating to 3% of total bus sales and bringing the global stock to approximately 635 000 in total. This relatively low share is primarily due to the limited sales shares in most EMDEs, as well as the low market penetration of electric buses in some larger markets such as the United States and Korea. Early policy support for electrifying public transport, and the availability of domestically produced electric buses, coupled with incentives, meant that China took an early and significant lead in electric bus sales. In 2020, China was responsible for about 90% of electric bus sales worldwide. In 2023, this fell to around 60%, largely due to a decrease in domestic demand for both electric and ICE buses and, to a less er extent, increasing sales in other regions. The fall in Chinese demand could be a consequence of the early success seen for electric buses – around 65% of China’s electric bus stock was deployed before 2019. It may also be linked to the ending of purchase subsidies for BEV and PHEV buses at the end of 2022. Despite China’s lead in global sales having shrunk, Chinese manufacturers continue to export large volumes of electric buses, accounting for over 85 % of electric city bus deployments in Latin America. They have also increased their market share in the European Union from 10% of bus sales in 2017 to 30% in 2023, driven by companies such as Yutong and BYD. City buses, in particular, have strong potential for electrification thanks to their relatively fixed driving patterns and low er daily travel distances, and have spearheaded growth in electric bus sales. In the European Union, BEVs reached a 43% sales share among city buses in 2023, demonstrating clear progress towards the proposed target of 100% of city bus sales being zero emission 10 “Trucks” refers to both medium (3.5-15 tonnes Gross Vehicle Weight [GVW]) and heavy (15 tonnes GVW and above) trucks.

There has also been encouraging progress in EMDEs, where a focus on the co- benefits of electric buses – such as reduced air pollution and greater access to public transport – has boosted take-up. This has been further supported by the wide availability of electric buses in already competitive markets. Cities across Latin America, such as Bogota and Santiago, have deployed nearly 6 500 electric buses to date. BasiGo, Africa’s largest electric bus company, has an order book of 350 buses, which represents almost 2% of electric bus sales outside of China in 2023, and aims to sell a further 1 000 electric buses in Kenya and 200 in Rwanda in the coming years. Along with high potential for electrification of city buses, infrastructure developments can also support the transition. The bus rapid transit (BRT) system, which is based on the use of dedicated bus lanes with priority access at intersections and off-board fare collection, can support the establishment of high- capacity, efficient services for cities. The new all-electric BRT system in Dakar – the first on the African continent – is a strong example. This network, announced at the end of 2023, will serve 320 000 passengers per day . Elsewhere, t he European bus rapid transit of 2030 ( eBRT2030) scheme aims to improve the urban transport environment by developing innovative solutions for electric BRTs, with demonstrations in Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona and Prague, among other cities.

The United States also saw a threefold increase, though electric truck sales reached just 1 200, less than 0.1% of total truck sales. We expect electric truck sales to continue to increase thanks to strong and ambitious policies, such as the European Union’s CO2 standards for HDVs, which target a 90% CO2 emissions reduction by 2040. In the United States, the newly adopted heavy-duty emissions regulation is expected to result in ZEV sales shares of up to 60% by 2032 in different segments. At the city level, zero emissions (or “green”) zones for freight , are being implemented in 15 different cities as diverse as London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Quito, Shenzhen, Seoul and Taoyuan City. Together, these cities have a total population of over 52 million. In addition, initiatives such as EV100+, the Global Memorandum of Understanding on Z ero-Emission Medium and H eavy Duty Vehicles co- led by Drive to Zero , the European Clean Trucking Alliance, the eTransport coalition, the First Movers Coalition– Trucking, and the Fleet Electrification Coalition have increas ed their membership. They continue to advocate for more ambitious policies, such as accelerated sales targets and zero emission government fleets. In the United States, there have been efforts to use demonstration projects to identify truck segments ripe for electrification. In June 2023, the North American Council for Freight Efficiency, together with the Rocky Mountain Institute, launched Run on Less – Electric DEPOT. Through this initiative, depots deployed almost 300 electric trucks of various sizes to gather telemetry data with the aim of identifying use cases where electric trucks are already a viable solution, as well as where challenges remain. Similarly, the UK Government is investing USD 250 million under the Zero Emission HGV and Infrastructure Programme t o run real -world trials of zero - emission trucks. The programme will deploy 370 trucks and almost 60 refuelling and electric charging sites. Electric truck adoption is also gaining momentum i n EMDEs outside of China. In India, NITI Aayog launched the Electric Freight Accelerator for Sustainable Transport, a pl atform to pioneer collaboration between the government and private sector partners for large-scale freight electrification. This initiative has spurred 16 major manufacturing and logistics companies to collectively signal demand for Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in heavy electric vehicles PAGE | 63 IEA.

New brands such as Rizon are targeting the electric medium-duty segment in North America , where despite their higher upfront costs, electric trucks are already competitive with diesel trucks in terms of total cost of ownership, especially when charged at depot as opposed to higher- cost public charging. Costs are even more competitive when factoring in incentives available in the United States and Canada.

Established OEMs such as Volvo Trucks, MAN, Mercedes, and Quantron offer vehicles in three or more segments. This wide range of offerings, coupled with an already strong position in the global market, and relatively low sales shares in Europe prior to 2023, meant there was less space for new entrants to compete. Manufacturers in the rest of the world have not responded to the electric HDV opportunity in the same way, mirroring the slower uptake of electric HDVs to date and fewer supportive policies than in leading electric HDV markets.

CC BY 4.0. 4. Trends in electric vehicle charging Charging for electric light-duty vehicles There are almost ten times as many private chargers as public ones, with most owners charging at home Home charging is currently the most common means of charging electric cars. EV owners with access to a private parking space that can be equipped for charging can charge o vernight, which is not only convenient but also typically takes advantage of lower electricity prices while demand is relatively low. The availability of home charging varies substantially between regions and is linked to differences in urban, suburban and rural populations, as well as income bracket. In dense cities, where most people live in multi-unit dwellings, access to home charging is more limited and EV owners rely more heavily on public charging. This is most apparent in Korea, which is one of the world’s most densely populated c ountries and has the highest ratio of public charging capacity to EVs. Though access to cha rging is different to actual use, it is a useful proxy for the levels of home charging among EV owners across countries. The share of EVs in new car sales is over 90% in Norway, whereas it stands at under 2% in Mexico, yet the shares of EV owners reportedly charging at home are similar, at 82% and 71%, respectively. The United Kingdom has one of the highest reported shares of access to home charging, at 93%, more than half of which are smart chargers.12 This is partly due to the United Kingdom being the first country to release smart charge point regulations , but, i mportantly , it could also be attributed to the high share of earl y EV adopters that also own a home in which a charger can be installed. In India, 55% of consumers state that they have access to home charging today. Changes to building regulations in order to mandate chargers, as have been proposed by the European Union, are an effective way of increasing access over time, especially for people who live in rented accommodation. In regions where the voltage of the power grid is 220V or above, EV owners can charge their vehicle from a regular domestic socket overnight.",

I n regions where the voltage is lower , typically 100 -120V, recharging speeds from regular domestic sockets are much slower,13 and can present a safety risk. As such, in countries with a 100-120V power grid, the ability to recharge in under ten hours requires installation of a dedicated charger.14 This is the case in some countries where the share of EV charging at home is high, such as the United States (83%) and Canada (80%). However, it also includes developing countries with ambitious electrification targets, such as Indonesia, Costa Rica and Colombia, where both the cost (in the region of several hundred US dollars) and lower availability of private parking spaces may present significant hurdles to private charger installation. R eliance on more expensive public charging may therefore be higher. Beyond home charging, private charging also includes other non-publicly accessible chargers, such as chargers reserved for the employees, fleets or customers of certain establishments. There are, for example, 15 900 such private non- home chargers in the United States. In the European Union, over 250 000 chargers are described as having restricted access. While home charging infrastructure is well established in many countries, the landscape for 2Ws is markedly different. S tock and sales of 2Ws continue to increase in India and the ASEAN countries. These growing markets also see growing momentum in battery swapping technologies, especially in India. In 2023, the Chinese Taipei-based battery -swapping company Gogoro announced a USD 2.5 billion partnership with the Indian State of Maharashtra. Gogoro intends to invest more than USD 1.5 billion in deploying smart battery infrastructure, which will include their battery swapping stations. Other Indian start -ups such as Sun Mobility and Battery Smart raised USD 50 million and USD 33 million, respectively, for further expansion of battery swapping infrastructure. Elsewhere, Africa has also seen increased investment in battery -swapping technologies for 2Ws. A mpersand, a Rwanda- based company , currently performs 140 000 monthly battery swaps to more than 1 700 customers that together travel 1.4 million km every week in Kigali and Nairobi. Spiro, an African electric 2W start- up, secured around USD 60 million in 2023 in order to expand its electric fleet and fund more than 1 000 swap stations.",

Governments are strengthening support for public charging infrastructure Although there are many more private charg ers, public charging and the interoperability of its infrastructure is key to enabling more widespread adoption of and more equitable access to EVs. The public charging stock increased by more than 40% in 2023 , and t he growth of f ast chargers – which reached 55% – outpaced that of slow chargers .15 At the end of 2023, fast chargers represented over 35% of public charging stock. Overall, China leads electric vehicle supply equipment ( EVSE) deployment, with more than 85% of the world's fast chargers, and around 60% of slow chargers. Having achieved an electric car sales share of over 35%, thus already surpassing their policy ambition for 2025, China is shifting focus to charging infrastructure development, targeting full coverage in cities and on highways by 2030, as well as expanded rural coverage. China has also begun to support more sustainable charging behaviour, with the aim that 60% of EV charging occurs off-peak by 2025, starting with five pilot cities. 15 Slow chargers have power ratings less than or equal to 22 kW, whereas fast chargers have a power rating of more than 22 kW and up to 350 kW. “Charging points” and “chargers” are used interchangeably and refer to the individual charging sockets, reflecting the number of EVs that can charge at the same time. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Private - home Private - other Public - slow Public - fast Million Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle charging PAGE | 70 IEA.",

In late 2023, the European Union agreed on the text of the alternative fuels infrastructure regulation ( AFIR), which will require public fast chargers every 60 km along the European Union’s main transport corridors ( Trans-European Transport Network [ TEN-T]). This will ensure that 1.3 kW of publicly accessible chargers are available for each registered BEV, and another 0.8 kW for each registered PHEV. Other developed markets are also expanding support for EVSE while reducing funding for vehicle incentives. The United Kingdom has ended subsidies for private cars, but maintained incentives for private and public charging installations, with more than 53 600 installed as of 2023, and 300 000 public chargers expected by 2030. New regulations relating to payments and reliability also aim to improve the customer experience. Elsewhere, Korea has reduced the value of its EV subsidy while committing funding to EVSE.

As the number of public chargers grows, attention is also turning to the interoperability of charging infrastructure. In the United States, SAE International announced it would use Tesla’s charging connector (J3400) as the standard across North America under the North American Charging Standard (NACS). The aim is to ensure that any supplier or manufacturer is able to use and deploy the connector, providing EV drivers with more options for reliable, convenient charging across North America. Both the AFIR regulation in Europe, and the NACS in North America , are examples of legislation enacted to enhance interoperability of the charging infrastructure. Achieving greater interoperability across more regions will require enhanced collaboration amongst all stakeholders in order to agree common standards and protocols. Public charging roll-out needs to keep pace with electric vehicle sales Deployment of EV chargers should be co-ordinated with power grid developments to ensure that new connections are consistent with the wider grid- planning horizon. When not managed appropriately, charging can lead to a surge in peak demand, meaning that it is increasingly important to ensure that transmission and distribution grids are appropriately sized and equipped. 17 Strategies to m anage charging, such as through time-of-use tariffs and smart-charging, will become more necessary as EV deployment grows. High ratios of publicly available charging capacity to EVs in use are crucial in regions where home charging is less accessible, and can help improve the consumer experience more widely. Sufficient coverage reduces concerns about range, and can allow for vehicles with lower battery capacity, thereby reducing costs and critical material demand. Accurately planning for the most appropriate ratio can prove challenging due to the varying supply and demand dynamics within individual countries. Insufficient public charging infrastructure (high EV :EVSE ratio) could lead to considerable customer inconvenience, while excessive 17 Further information on the impact of EV charging on the electricity grid can be found in the IEA’s Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions report.

Finding an appropriate balance is important to ensuring optimal utilisation and satisfaction among EV users. It may be more relevant to consider the total charging capacity per EV rather than EV:EVSE ratio, given that fast chargers can serve more EVs per day than slow chargers. In the initial phases of infrastructure development, the ratio of charging capacity to EV is generally high, given that charger usage will likely be low until the market matures.

CC BY 4.0. Charging for electric heavy-duty vehicles Dedicated charging for heavy-duty vehicles is the next frontier Electric HDVs can generally use the same charging points as LDVs, but the larger size of both the vehicle and battery, and the resulting longer charging times required can disrupt normal operations, ultimately creating a need for dedicated equipment and facilities. HDV charging facilities of this kind are still in the early stages of large-scale development and deployment. Progress is being made globally on developing standards for megawatt -scale chargers, with the aim of achieving maximum interoperability for electric HDVs. This will be essential to enable a fast roll -out of the charging technology, and mitigate any potential risks and challenges faced by vehicle manufacturers, importers, international operators and equipment providers. In 2023, the European Union and United States produced a set of recommendations for charging infrastructure, including the harmonisation of standards between the two regions. In essence, this provided recognition of the adoption of the megawatt charging system (MCS) – which allows charging capacity up to 3.75 MW – by international standardisation organisations such as SAE International and the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO). Some companies such as Kempower, who mainly operate in Europe but are expanding globally, are expected to introduce chargers designed to operate at up to 1.2 MW in 2024, ahead of the formal standardisation of the MCS, though this is not expected to cause issues of divergence. I n Asia, predominantly in China and Japan, the ChaoJi-2 began demonstration in late 2023. Although ChaoJi-2 has a lower power rating than the MCS (up to 1.2 MW), it allows for compatibility with existing standards in the region.18 In March 2024, the United States released the National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy. This sets out a phas ed approach to electrifying road freight , starting with establishing charging hubs at locations such as rail yards and airports, before expanding the network with the aim of achieving full coverage sometime between 2035 and 2040. Smaller demonstrations have also been undertaken, such as the Run on Less – Electric DEPOT scheme, through which around 140 charging points were installed at 10 depots across the United States. According to data collected by the Atlas EV Hub, a further 210 charging points are already operating in the United States to serve electric trucks, and another 1 020 are planned, around 75% of which are due to be completed in 2024.",

To date, there are around 160 truck-specific charging points deployed in Europe. In early 2023, Europe’s first truck charging corridor was launched along a 600 km stretch of the Rhine- Alpine corridor , one of the busiest road freight routes in Europe. All 6 public charging locations are fitted with 300 kW charging points. The company behind the corridor, BP pulse, is also electrifying one of the largest truck stops i n the United Kingdom. Looking forward, t he EU AFIR details the progressive roll-out of minimum coverage and capacity for HDV charging stations, specifying that each station must include at least one charger of at least 350 kW power output by the end of 2025. Alongside national policies, AFIR has sparked the creation of several pilot programmes dedicated to charging HDVs using MCS charging, such as HoLa, ZEFES, HV-MELA-BAT, and a joint ABB and Scania project. In late 2023, Milence, an independent joint venture established by Traton, Volvo and Daimler, presented their HDV charger. In collaboration with Hitachi Energy , they plan to build 1 700 public charging points across Europe by 2027, based on the MCS. Although high-powered charging can enable the decarbonisation of freight, it may also present challenges for the electricity grid, like fluctuations in power quality or supply-demand imbalances. These imbalances can cause grid congestion at the local level, and could affect entire regions where there is a large electric HDV fleet. Some countries , such as the Netherlands, are already developing polic ies to anticipate these issues. One way to mitigate challenges and avoid peak demand is through stationary storage batter ies that are co- located with high- powered chargers. This solution would require significant capital expenditure (CAPEX) for the installation of large , stationary batteries, but it could also offer new revenue streams to charging station owners, such as through electricity price arbitrage or grid services provision. Co-locating renewable sources close to charging hubs can also decrease the stress on the local power grid.",

Battery swapping can be completed in as little as five minutes, can help to extend battery life through more controlled charging, and can spread power demand over a longer period, thus reducing pressure on the electricity grid. Battery swapping is currently most developed in China, where it has been encouraged by national and local governments since 2020. As many as half of electric heavy-duty trucks sold in 2023 were enabled with battery-swapping technology. In late 2022 , SAIC launched a joint venture to set up around 40 battery swapping stations in cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen, with the aim of installing 3 000 stations by 2025. In 2023 , CATL, the world’s largest producer of EV batteries, launched QIJI Energy, an all-in-one heavy-duty truck chassis battery - swapping solution, which aims to reduce costs by building upon existing battery technology. Electric road systems (ERS) allow vehicles to charge while they are driving, using one of three main technologies : induction between the vehicle and the road, conduction connections between the vehicle and road, or catenary lines.19 With increased access to charging through ERS, vehicles would require less battery capacity, leading to reduced battery demand and a more equal distribution of power demand throughout the day , with the trade- off being a greater and more distributed overall infrastructure requirement. ERS have significantly progressed in countries including Sweden, France, Germany, Italy, Israel and the United States. In 2023, Sweden became the first country in the world to commit to turning a highway into a permanently electrified road.",

In 2023, Sweden became the first country in the world to commit to turning a highway into a permanently electrified road. Though the exact charging method has yet to be decided, the planned road should open to the public by 2025, with up to 3 000 km of further road expansion by 2045. In France, a study for the Ministry of Transport on the impact of ERS concluded that it could reduce CO 2 emissions by 86% for road freight trucks that currently run on diesel. The installation of nearly 5 000 km of ERS by 2030 has been proposed, and the first stage of this project is expected in 2024 with a proof of concept being installed on 2 km of motorway to the southwest of Paris. In Germany, a catenary system was installed over 10 km of motorway in 2019 as part of a pilot trial, and a further 7 km have since been added , with long-term aspirations for the entire A5 motorway to be fitted with ERS. Other countries such as Italy and Israel have already completed proof-of-concept trials run by Electreon. 19 Catenary lines can only be used for HDVs due to the suspension of overhead wires for delivering electricity. Conductive charging works for both HDVs and LDVs where there is a conductive system embedded in the road. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 78 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 5. Trends in electric vehicle batteries Battery supply and demand Demand for batteries and critical minerals continues to grow, led by electric car sales Increasing EV sales continue driving up global battery demand, with fastest growth in 2023 in the United States and Europe The growth in EV sales is pushing up demand for batteries, continuing the upward trend of recent years. Demand for EV batteries reached more than 750 GWh in 2023, up 40% relative to 2022, though the annual growth rate slow ed slightly compared to in 2021-2022. Electric cars account for 95% of this growth. Globally, 95% of the growth in battery demand related to EVs was a result of higher EV sales, while about 5% came from larger average battery size due to the increasing share of SUVs within electric car sales.

Nevertheless, the United States remains the smallest market of the three, with around 100 GWh in 2023, compared to 185 GWh in Europe and 415 GWh in China. In the rest of the world, battery demand growth jumped to more than 70% in 2023 compared to 2022, as a result of increasing EV sales. In China, PHEVs accounted for about one-third of total electric car sales in 2023 and 18% of battery demand, up from one- quarter of total sales in 2022 and 17% of sales in 2021. PHEV batteries are smaller than those used in BEVs , thereby contributing less to increasing battery demand. In recent years, Chinese carmakers have also been marketing more extended-range EVs (EREVs), which use an electric motor as their unique powertrain but have a combustion engine that can be used to recharge the battery when needed. EREVs typically have a battery size about twice that of a PHEV, enabling a real-world electric range of around 150 km compared to 65 km for traditional PHEVs. With an ICE on board, EREVs can reach ranges of around 1 000 km when needed. In 2023 , EREVs accounted for 25% of PHEV sales in China, up from about 15% in 2021 -2022. Negligible EREV sales are recorded in other regions. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 79 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

High levels of investment in mining and refining in the past 5 years have ensured that global supply can comfortably meet demand today, not only for EVs but also in historical markets including portable electronics, ceramics, metals and alloys . In 2023, the supply of cobalt and nickel exceeded demand by 6.5% and 8%, and supply of lithium by over 10%, thereby bringing down critical mineral prices and battery costs. While low critical mineral prices help bring battery costs down, they also imply lower cash flows and narrowe r margins for mining companies. Compared to just a few years earlier, overcapacity means that many companies are now struggling to stay afloat (see later section on t rends in the EV industry). Mining and refining will need to continue growing quickly to meet future demand, to avoid supply chain bottlenecks and make supply chains more resilient to potential disruptions . Doing so will also require striking a balance between remaining profitable while competing on prices. Innovative technologies such as sodium-ion batteries can potentially mitigate demand for critical minerals, together with the rise of mature battery chemistries requiring lower amounts of critical metals, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP). 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 GWh / year LDV Two/three-wheeler Bus Truck 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 China Europe United States RoW Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 80 IEA.

China’s current leading role in battery production, however, comes at the cost of high levels of overcapacity . In 2023, excluding portable electronics , China used less than 40% of its maximum cell output, 20 and cathode and anode active material installed manufacturing capacity was almost 4 and 9 times greater than global EV cell demand in 2023. To take advantage of some of this excess capacity, China is the biggest exporter of EV cells, cathodes and anodes globally.

At the same time, international co-operation and trade in battery technologies will continue to underpin EV market expansion. Just as for current capacity, announcements for additional EV battery manufacturing capacity in Europe and the United States are primarily made by foreign companies headquartered in Asia.

In terms of regional competitiveness, batteries are cheapest in China, followed by North America, Europe and other Asia Pacific countries. However, battery prices across regions, including both batteries produced locally and imports, have been converging in the past few years, indicating that EV batteries are moving towards becoming a truly globalised product. Nonetheless, battery manufacturing in Europe and the United States remains more expensive than in China. For example, producing a battery cell in the United States is nearly 20%22 more expensive than in China, even when assuming that material costs do not vary regionally. In reality, Chinese manufacturers are likely to benefit from preferential prices from local material producers and a more integrated supply chain within China, which could mean the manufacturing cost gap is even larger. Moreover, contrary to the United States and Europe, most Chinese batteries are LFP, which is more than 20% cheaper to produce than NMC. 21 Battery packs used in EVs are typically made of a series of modules, each containing several battery cells. In the cell-to- pack configuration, battery cells are assembled to build a pack without using modules, which reduces the need for inert materials and increases energy density. In cell-to-chassis concepts, battery cells are used as part of the EV structure without being assembled into a battery pack beforehand. 22 Calculations from the BNEF BattMan 3.1.0 model using NMC811 as cathode and graphite as anode.

In 2022, the core LFP patents expired, sparking interest in production outside of China.

    "text": "Further declines in battery cost and critical mineral reliance might come from sodium-ion batteries, which can be produced using similar production lines to those used for lithium-ion batteries. The need for critical minerals like nickel and manganese for sodium-ion batteries depends on the cathode chemistry used, but no sodium-ion chemistries require lithium. Similarly to LFP, sodium-ion batteries were initially developed in the United States and Europe, but today the announced sodium-ion manufacturing capacity in China is estimated to be about ten times higher than in the rest of the world combined. M anufacturing capacity outside China is still at the laboratory or pilot scale. In 2023, leading battery manufacturers announced expansion plans for sodium - ion batteries, such as BYD , Northvolt and CATL, which initially sought to reach mass production by the end of the same year . If brought to scale, sodium-ion batteries could cost up to 20% less than incumbent technologies and be suitable for applications such as compact urban EVs and power stationary storage, while enhancing energy security. The development and cost advantages of sodium-ion batteries are, however, strongly dependent on lithium prices, with current low prices discouraging investments in sodium -ion and delaying expansion plans . Supply chain bottlenecks, such as for high- quality cathode and anode materials specific to sodium-ion batteries, could also hinder near-term expansion. 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 2021 2022 2023 2021 2022 2023 2021 2022 2023 2021 2022 2023 World China Europe United States LFP High-nickel Low-nickel Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 87 IEA.

CC BY 4.0. 6. Trends in the electric vehicle industry Electric vehicle company strategy and market competition Electric vehicle companies perform well in financial markets, but volatility and competition raise concern Since 2019, the stocks of EV companies – including vehicle and battery manufacturers and companies involved in the extraction or processing of battery metals – have consistently outperformed general stock markets, major traditional carmakers, and other segments of clean technology. Return on investment has increased more over the 2019- 2023 period for these companies than it has for others, in relative terms . The combined market capitalisation of pure play EV makers boomed from USD 100 billion in 2020 to USD 1 trillion at the end of 2023, with a peak over USD 1.6 trillion at the end of 2021, though this trend was primarily driven by Tesla. T he market capitalisation of battery makers and battery metal companies also increased significantly over the same period. Behind this overall upward trend, however, there has been significant volatility. Supply chain disruptions and battery metal price fluctuations – notably in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – as well as increasing competition, price wars among OEMs and expectations of slower relative annual growth as major EV markets mature, and of possible consolidation, are having an important downward impact on investor confidence and EV stocks. For example, Tesla’s shares were on average 15% lower in 2023 than in 2021-2022; BYD’s average stock also fell 15% in 2023 relative to 2022 ; and the combined market capitalisation of pure play EV carmakers fell by nearly 20% on average relative to 2022, while that of major incumbent carmakers remained flat. Many emerging EV players – such as VinF ast from Viet Nam , Polestar from Europe, and Canoo, Fisker, Lucid and Nikola from the United States – are missing sales targets and trading low. Fiercer competition and shrinking profits also have an impact upstream, among EV battery makers: in the first weeks of 2024, CATL was trading near a three-year low, with a market capitalisation at its lowest point since the end of 2020. In the first quarter of 2024, the combined market capitalisation of pure play EV players fell below that of major incumbents, even if their financial stock performance remained robust.",

CC BY 4.0. As a result of increasing investor appetite and growing EV markets, the valuation of critical mineral companies has increased significantly in the last few years. Over the 2015 -2022 period, the market capitalisation of companies involved in the extraction and processing of lithium increased sixfold. The margins for lithium , nickel and copper companies typically outperformed those of the top 100 mining companies over the same period, including relative to gold or iron ore. However, the picture in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 is changing. The volatile metal prices seen in the past few years, the increasing competition and pressure to drive down EV and battery prices, and the current overcapacity for several critical minerals (see earlier section on batteries) , mean that major mining companies are revisiting growth and performance forecasts. After several years of important cash flows as a result of high prices and increasing volumes , many companies are now starting to struggle to finance both existing and new projects with their own revenues, suggesting external sources will be needed for large- scale capital expenditure. In Australia, for example, Albemarle, Core Lithium , Liontown Resources and Pilbara Minerals announced project spending reductions, lower dividends, and job cuts in 2024 . Albermarle expects capital expenditures to drop by around USD 500 million from USD 2.1 billion in 2023 to USD 1.6-1.8 billion in 2024, and plans to reduce annual costs by nearly USD 100 million. Pilbara Minerals expects annual exploration spending to be cut by up to AUD 100 million (USD 66 million). Nickel and cobalt projects in Australia have also been delayed or halted, involving companies like BHP, First Quantum Minerals and Wyloo Metals.",

Global competition is getting tougher, pushing down company margins Road transport electrification is reshuffling cards in global markets, as carmakers compete fiercely to capture their share of a growing pie. BYD and Tesla remain far ahead of the curve, together accounting for 35% of all electric car sales in 2023. This is more than all the major carmakers outside China combined (just above 30%), and more than all the other Chinese carmakers (just under 30%). BYD and Tesla’s rise as global front-runners has primarily dented the market share of major incumbents, which accounted for 55% of global electric car sales in 2015 but have been falling behind ever since. In 2022, BYD had already overtaken Tesla as the world’s best-selling EV company when accounting for plug- in hybrid cars. In the second half of 2023, BYD also became the world’s best-selling battery electric car company. Counting both BEV and PHEV models, BYD’s share of global electric car markets was just over 20%.

Gross margin for 2024 and 2025 estimated by companies in their annual reporting. Sources: IEA analysis based on Bloomberg and EV Volumes. In China, since the end of 2022, greater competition among front-runners has led electric car prices to fall quickly. The price of compact electric cars and SUVs dropped by up to 10% in 2023 relative to 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla once again slashed prices, by up to 6% or CNY 15 000 for its Models 3 and Y, forcing competitors to follow by squeezing margins. BYD proceeded with a 10- 20% cut on model prices, such as a CNY 10 000 reduction on its flagship Qin Plus; XPeng with a CNY 20 000 cut on its G6 series; and the GM -SAIC-Wuling joint venture with a CNY 6 000 cut on its Xingguang sedan. Tesla has been able to afford such a strategy thus far thanks to a focus on high- end models and greater profits per car sold, around USD 10 000 to USD 15 000 per electric car sold in 2022-2023 against around USD 6 000 for BYD, which also explains why Tesla’s market value in 2023 remained 7 times higher than that of BYD. BYD’s preferred strategy has been to sell cheaper models and protect margins by developing in-house battery supply chains. Other Chinese makers are now actively seeking to catch up by announcing new models. For example, XPeng announced new models for 2024 priced at around CNY 100 000-150 000, far more affordable than the premium models typically priced in the range of CNY 300 000.

In the United States, Tesla accounted for over 45 % of all the battery electric cars ever sold as of 2023. However, Tesla’s share in new US electric car sales has been shrinking, from over 60% in 2020 to 45% in 2023. Hyundai- Kia overtook GM and Ford in 2023, and now accounts for 8% of US electric car sales, second only to Tesla. Hyundai -Kia plans to start manufacturing operations at a Georgia- based factory in 2024, qualifying for IRA benefits. European carmakers accounted for 25% of US electric car sales, their highest share since 2017, led by Stellantis. About 15% of BMW’s sales were electric, meeting its 2023 sales target, and in the same year the company went on record as saying that a tipping point for ICE cars had been reached, and that EVs would lead future growth. Meanwhile, other US carmakers accounted for 15% of electric car sales, half their share back in the 2015-2017 period, and GM and Ford announced a step back from their earlier sales objectives (see later section on Industry Outlook). In Europe, the share of electric car sales by local carmakers has been falling since 2015. In 2023, European carmakers accounted for 60% of electric car sales in the region, compared to over 80% in 2015. Volkswagen, Stellantis and BMW aggregated to 45% of European electric car sales in 2023, but competition is getting tougher among front -runners.

CC BY 4.0. between 2015 and 2023, while Chinese carmakers have seen important growth, from 5% in 2015 to just under 15% in 2023. Global competition is expected to further intensify in the coming years, especially as Chinese carmakers look to export in the context of battery and EV oversupply. Just as for steel and solar PV, China’s subsidised industrial strategy for EVs, which was initiated 15 years ago, has led to significant excess capacity. Capacity utilisation stood below 70% among the top 10 sellers in the first months of 2023 . There are also far more EV companies in China than can possibly survive in a competitive market . In 2014 alone, ten years ago, over 80 000 companies registered in China entered the electromobility sector. In 2023, over 80% of electric car sales in China were concentrated in just over 30 companies. In 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology noted its concern that too many carmakers remain unprofitable. Nio, for example, recorded net losses of USD 3 billion in 2023. As shrinking margins push the least profitable out of the race, China’s EV industry is consolidating around a smaller number of robust champions – and they are looking abroad for expansion. Chinese auto exports grew steeply in 2023, up 60% relative to 2022, making China the world’s largest car exporter, ahead of Japan and Germany. Despite high import taxes (e.g. 27% in the United States and 10% in the European Union) and tight regulatory scrutiny (e.g. the anti-subsidy EU investigation on EV imports since October 2023 and possible introduction of new tariffs f rom July 2024) , Chinese OEMs often remain more competitive than incumbents. They could be well-placed to capture market share in the near term, especially in the small car segment. In early 2024, for example, BYD chartered its first cargo ship, with a capacity of 7 000 cars sailing to Europe. European and US carmakers are under growing pressure as Chinese carmakers start to export at scale, and are adjusting corporate strategy accordingly . In February 2024, for example , Ford and GM expressed that they could even be open to partnering to compete against Chinese carmakers, and BYD in particular.",

European and US carmakers are under growing pressure as Chinese carmakers start to export at scale, and are adjusting corporate strategy accordingly . In February 2024, for example , Ford and GM expressed that they could even be open to partnering to compete against Chinese carmakers, and BYD in particular. Ford estimates losses on EV investments of up to USD 5.5 billion in 2023, and expects even tougher future competition from more affordable Tesla models and Chinese carmakers. Another example comes from Stellantis, which – considering the growing importance of Chinese pure play EV ma nufacturers on the global market – recently became an important shareholder of China’s Leapmotor brand. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in the electric vehicle industry PAGE | 95 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electric vehicle and battery start-ups Venture capital investments in electric vehicle start-ups dropped in 2023, following the global trend Venture capital (VC) funding to EV start-ups has boomed in the past decade. Financial investors such as banks and VC or private equity funds see in EV start- ups a potential for significant future returns. Many companies – including major incumbent carmakers – also use corporate VC to fund start-ups to develop new technology, or to acquire concepts developed by new entrants . Whereas in the past century, most carmakers typically developed ICE technology and manufacturing through in- house R&D, investing in start -ups has now become a notable trend. This allows incumbents to bolster their own position and maintain a competitive edge in quickly evolving markets and regulatory environments. In 2023, however, global VC investments in clean energy start -ups fell considerably relative to 2022, and EVs and batteries were no exception. Early- stage investments (i.e. seed and series A, referring to the first rounds of financing and the earlier stages of development) in start-ups developing EV and battery technologies dropped 20% to USD 1.4 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, growth-stage investments (i.e. series B and growth equity, which refer to the later rounds of financing as start-ups increase activity) dropped 35% to USD 10.1 billion. Several important factors are contributing to this downward trend. As competition intensifies in EV and battery markets, and as incumbents ramp up their own investments and manufacturing plans, barriers to entry for new actors get higher, and so do investor perceptions of risk. The front-running start-ups that raised funds over the 2015-2020 period are now maturing and transitioning to other sources of capital, leaving fewer alternatives for newcomers – early-stage VC for electric carmakers dropped radically in 2023. Geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, high energy prices , and rising inflation and interest rates limit the availability of higher-risk capital. We also observe a cooldown following the post- Covid-19 boom of 2021-2022, which was fuelled by investment restraint during the pandemic and the expectation of significant economic recovery packages afterwards. Despite the drop, investments remain far greater than in 2019, prior to the Covid- 19 pandemic .",

Start- ups developing EV charging technology attracted over USD 400 million in early -stage VC, and battery and battery component makers USD 260 million, together accounting for half of early-stage VC. There was also a surge for two- and three-wheeler start-ups, which raised USD 200 million in early- stage VC in 2023, up from below USD 100 million in previous years.

Notable deals in 2023 included Germany-based Jolt Energy’s first round of VC funding, which raised USD 160 million. The company seeks to bring its fast - charging technology to urban areas of Europe and the United States, and claims to provide 100 km of driving range in just 5 minutes. Similarly, German EV charging start-up Numbat raised USD 75 million in series A funding through the European Infrastructure Fund, as well as another USD 75 million in loans. Indian start-up Charge Zone also raised nearly USD 55 million to develop nearly 300 charging stations. Chinese electric truck maker DeepWay raised USD 110 million in series A funding to start mass production, after having raised USD 70 million in 2022 to fund R&D and early-stage manufacturing. In the 2/3W space, Benin-based start-up Spiro raised USD 60 million, Indonesian Maka Motors raised over USD 37 million and Volta Indonesia USD 35 million, Brazilian Vammo raised USD 30 million, and Indian Simple Energy India raised USD 20 million, illustrating the importance of this segment in EMDEs. In India, Evera, a provider of all-electric cab services and management, raised USD 7 million to expand operations in Delhi, and Zyngo, an operator of electric last-mile delivery fleets, raised USD 5 million. At the growth stage, battery technology developers attracted USD 5 billion, and electric carmakers USD 2.5 billion, with significant support from public investors , indicating interest from governments to help new entrants ramp up manufacturing capacity or accelerate expansion and deployment . However, growth- stage investor appetite for electric trucks and EV charging dried up relative to previous years. Notable deals include French battery maker Verkor, which raised USD 900 million in growth equity from investors including public -private EIT InnoEnergy and BPI France, and major incumbent carmaker Renault.",

In the electric taxi fleet space, India- based BluSmart, a start -up providing ride- hailing services, raised two rounds of USD 42 million and USD 24 million in growth equity in 2023, and another USD 25 million in 2024. However, there has been fierce competition with larger taxi fleet apps and operators in the past few years in EMDEs. In 2023, for example, electric ride-sharing app Beat, owned by Free Now, withdrew from Latin America. Leading electric vehicle start-ups and venture capital investments are geographically concentrated Similarly to for other clean energy technologies, start-ups for EVs are predominantly headquartered in the United States, Europe or China. There is, however, significant variability across different EV technology areas. Over the 2018-2023 period, in cumulative terms, about 70% of the VC investments in start- ups developing electric cars were made in China, 20% in the United States and 10% in Europe. Meanwhile, about 95% of the VC investments in electric trucks, buses, and commercial vehicles were made in the United States. India, the only EMDE other than China that has a significant share in global VC markets, accounted for 70% of the investments in start-ups developing electric 2/3Ws. Over the 2018-2023 period, Indian EV start-ups raised USD 2.7 billion, of which over 70% was for electric 2/3Ws. Policy support has contributed to building investor appetite for the EV sector, and the high investment levels seen in 2022 and 2023 will warrant further examination in 2024 and beyond if the FAME subsidies are reduced or phased out. The investment potential in India’s EV sector is estimated at around USD 200 billion, suggesting there are still considerable opportunities ahead for Indian entrepreneurs and start-ups. With regards to batteries, start-ups based in the United States attracted most VC investments – from 30% to over 80% of global investments over the 2018-2023 period. Investments in battery makers, however, were split evenly among major VC markets, with 30% each for China, Europe and the United States.",

Investors look to new battery chemistries, recycling, and critical mineral extraction and refining technologies As VC investors look for new opportunities across EV supply chains, novel battery concepts and critical mineral extraction and refining are gaining momentum. Over the 2018 -2020 period, cumulative early-stage VC flowing to battery and component makers stood around USD 430 million, nearly 75% of which was for lithium-based battery chemistr ies. Over the 2021- 2023 period, cumulative investments for batteries not only more than tripled, to nearly USD 1.4 billion, they also diversified. Lithium chemistries accounted for just 60% of the total, while the share of emerging concepts such as metal -hydrogen, redox-flow, solid state and sodium-ion batteries rose, growing from less than 15% to more than 25%. Not all the start-ups active in the battery space today will eventually serve EV supply chains. In fact, many companies in our sample have so far announced that long-duration power storage is their primary target market. However, there are important spillover opportunities between those two closely related technology fields. For example, sodium-ion batteries can be used for both grid- level storage and EVs, and learnings in one sector can inform technology development in the other. Notable early-stage VC deals in novel battery chemistries in 2023 included rounds by Chinese WeView (USD 90 million), United States-based Noon Energy (USD 30 million) and XL Batteries (USD 10 million), and Singapore’s VFlow Tech (USD 10 million), all of which are developing redox -flow batteries.

Chinese Tianneng New Materials raised a series A of USD 140 million, and French MECAWARE USD 40 million. As reported last year, critical minerals VC is also expanding, standing just under USD 400 million in 2023, or nearly twice as much as in 2021 or 2022. T his technology field attracted under USD 75 million in cumulative VC over the 2018-2020 period. Cobalt extraction attracted nearly USD 200 million in 2023, just like in 2022. Lithium extraction and refining attracted USD 135 million, much higher than the dip of 2022 but still below the record year of 2021. We now observe deals for nickel extraction, suggesting investors are also looking for opportunities beyond cobalt and lithium. In 2023, several governments have also launched critical raw material funds. For example, France committed EUR 500 million to the EUR 2 billion private equity Critical Metals Fund managed by InfraVia, as part of France 2030. Similarly, EIT InnoEnergy launched the European Battery Alliance’s Strategic Battery Raw Material Fund, targeting investments of EUR 500 m illion. Other announcements and projects are mentioned in the later section on Industry Outlook in this report. Notable critical mineral deals in 2023 included a series A of USD 50 million by Canada-based Summit Nanotech to scale its more sustainable lithium extraction technology, after it received grants from public investors such as Sustainable Development Technology Canada and Natural Resources Canada. In the United States, Kobold Metals raised USD 195 million in growth equity to expand cobalt extraction, Energy Exploration Technologies raised USD 50 million for direct lithium extraction from GM Ventures , and Atlas Materials raised USD 27 million in seed money to develop nickel extraction technologies.

Outlook for electric mobility Scenario overview In this part of the report, we focus on pathways to electrify road transport over the period to 2035, expanding the time horizon by five years compared with previous editions of the Global EV Outlook. A scenario-based approach is used to explore the outlook for electric mobility, based on recent market trends, policy drivers and technology developments. The purpose of the scenarios is to assess plausible futures for global electric vehicle (EV) markets and their potential implications. The scenarios do not make predictions about the future. Rather, they aim to provide insights to inform decision-making by governments, companies and other stakeholders about the future of EVs. The projections in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) consider historical data through the end of 2023, as well as stated policies and ambitions as of the end of March 2024. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is consistent with the 2023 update to the IEA Net Zero Roadmap and the World Energy Outlook 2023. Deployment of electric vehicles is projected by road transport mode and by region. Regional results are presented for the STEPS and APS, while the discussion of the projections in the NZE Scenario focuses on global results. These projections are then compared to announcements by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and battery manufacturing capacity expansion announcements. These scenario projections incorporate GDP assumptions from the International Monetary Fund and population assumptions from the United Nations. Stated Policies Scenario The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) reflects existing policies and measures, as well as firm policy ambitions and objectives that have been legislated by governments around the world. It includes current EV-related policies, regulations and investments, as well as market trends based on the expected impacts of technology developments, announced deployments and plans from industry stakeholders. The STEPS aims to hold up a mirror to the plans of policy makers and illustrate their consequences. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 103 IEA. CC BY 4.0.",

Announced Pledges Scenario The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes that all announced ambitions and targets made by governments around the world are met in full and on time. With regards to electromobility, it includes all recent major announcements of electrification targets and longer -term net zero emissi ons and other pledges, regardless of whether these have been anchored in legislation or in updated Nationally Determined Contributions. For example, the APS assumes that countries that have signed on to the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emissions cars and vans will achieve this goal, even if there are not yet policies or regulations in place to support it. In countries that have not yet made a net zero emissions pledge or set electrification ta rgets, the APS considers the same policy framework as the STEPS. Non-policy assumptions for the APS, including population and economic growth, are the same as in the STEPS. The difference between the APS and the STEPS represents the “implementation gap” that exists between the policy frameworks and measures required to achieve country ambitions and targets, and the policies and measures that have been legislated. Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is a normative scenario that sets out a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The scenario is compatible with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C with no or limited temperature overshoot, in line with reductions assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. There are many possible paths to achieve net zero CO 2 emissions globally by 2050 and many uncertainties that could affect them. The NZE Scenario is therefore a path and not the path to net zero emissions. The difference between the NZE Scenario and the APS highlights the “ambition gap” that needs to be closed to achieve the goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement.

The global sales shares of electric light -duty vehicles ( LDVs), buses and trucks are fairly similar in both the STEPS and APS to 2030, suggesting that the gap between policy implementation and announced ambitions is small over the near term. This gap grows to 2035, given that many policies are focused on the near - to medium term, while strategy documents outlining ambitions tend to be longer - sighted. Further, the gap between announced ambitions and a global trajectory to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is larger than the policy implementation gap. In the NZE Scenario, 100% of light vehicle sales, including 2/3Ws, cars and vans, are zero-emission vehicles by 2035.

There are, however, differences by region. China, Europe and the United States, – the largest vehicle and EV markets today – all have both ambitious targets and ambitious policies to achieve those targets. This is well illustrated by the extremely small gap between electric car sales in the STEPS and in the APS in 2030.

This is a result of strong policy support, including light-duty vehicle fuel economy and CO2 standards, as well as the availability of EV models and, more generally, the sheer size of the LDV market. For example, over the past year, Canada and the United Kingdom implemented policies to increase zero -emission vehicle ( ZEV) sales in 2030, targeting 60% and 80% of PLDVs, respectively. As a result, electric LDV sales are projected to triple to over 43 million in 2030 in the STEPS, accounting for 40% of total LDV sales.

In the APS, sales of electric LDVs reach 47 million in 2030 and 75 million in 2035, representing two-thirds of sales in 2035. This reflects government electrification ambitions and net zero pledges, such as the Zero Emission Vehicles Declaration to achieve 100% zero -emission LDV sales by 2040, and by 2035 in leading markets, which has been signed by 40 national governments spanning six continents. The fleet of electric LDVs reaches more than 565 million in 2035, representing one in three LDVs. Of these, 525 million are electric PLDVs, with only 7% being LCVs. China is set to remain the leading region for electric LDV sales in the STEPS, though its share in global sales is expected to shrink from almost 60% in 2023 to around 40% in 2030 and 2035. The relative decline in China’s global share is due in part to the United States nearly doubling its share of global electric LDV sales to around one-fifth in both 2030 and 2035, thanks to a combination of policy efforts and industry ramp-up (see below).

This trend has been supported by policy measures such as purchase subsidies in countries including India and Indonesia, and targets for electrifying the 2/3W fleet, predominantly in emerging and developing economies, which represent 90% of the global conventional 2/3Ws stock today. For example, the Dominican Republic aims for 5% of the private motorcycle fleet to be electric by 2030, Pakistan targets 50% electric 2/3W sales by 2030, and Rwanda targets a 30% fleet share of electric 2/3Ws. In the APS, the stock grows to 430 million in 2035, meaning 40% of all 2/3Ws on the roads are electric. The sales share of electric 2/3Ws in 2035 reaches 60% in the STEPS and 75% in the APS. China is the front -runner, with a sales share of around 90% by 2035 in both scenarios. In the NZE Scenario, the global electric 2/3W sales share reaches close to 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Getting on track with the NZE Scenario is achievable with no technological breakthroughs or major market adaptations. Given the light weight and limited daily driving distance of 2/3Ws, electrification is relatively easy and already makes economic sense on a total cost of ownership basis in many countries. However, unlike for cars, vans and HDVs, there are currently no global initiatives to reach 100% zero-emission 2/3W sales. Strengthening regulations on emissions (or even noise pollution) from 2/3Ws can play a key role in increasing the adoption of electric 2/3Ws, along with purchase subsidies to ease any barriers for lower-income households presented by higher purchase prices compared to ICE 2/3Ws. Electric buses are projected to represent 30% of buses sold globally by 2035 based on existing policies In recent years, a number of governments have announced new funding for electric and zero-emission buses. For example, the United Kingdom has launched a second iteration of its zero emission bus program me that will provide GBP 129 million (almost USD 160 million) to support deployment over the next few years. As announced in late 2023, India is targeting 50 000 electric buses on its roads by 2027. There are also longer-standing programmes, such as the Zero Emission Bus Rapid- deployment Accelerator pa rtnership that was launched in 2019 to accelerate the deployment of zero -emission buses in major Latin American cities.",

Further, the Philippines and Solomon Islands recently joined countries including the Dominican Republic, Nepal, Pakistan and Panama in setting specific targets for decarbonising their bus fleets. 24 Perhaps the biggest push for electric buses in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) has been at the city level. Jakarta, Indonesia, aims to electrify its fleet of 10 000 buses by 2030, with the first 100 purchased in late 2023. Uzbekistan aims to purchase 300 electric buses in its capital Tashkent and in Samarkand. Buenos Aires is targeting a 50% zero- emission bus fleet by 2030, and a wider study of 32 Latin American cities expects that 25 000 electric buses will be deployed by 2030, and 55 000 by 2050. Such targets mean that in the APS, sales of electric buses in 2035 are almost 40% higher than in the STEPS, reaching almost 1 million sales. One in four buses on the road in 2035 is electric. In the NZE Scenario, electric bus sales reach significantly higher levels: by 2035, almost 90% of bus sales are electric. Trucks continue to be slowest to electrify, but country commitments could help boost progress Zero emissions vehicles could achieve total cost of ownership parity in many HDV applications this decade, including long-haul trucks, according to recent research. And the adoption of stringent emissions standards could also help to make electric options more attractive by increasing the cost of ICE buses and trucks. Nevertheless, medium- and heavy-duty trucks may prove more difficult to electrify than other segments, in part due to the size and weight of their batteries, as well as charging requirements.",

China is expected to surpass a 50% electric car sales share in the next few years The current momentum in electric car sales has led to anticipation in China that passenger new energy vehicle (NEV) sales could reach a 50% share as soon as 2025, as stated in the recent Automotive Industry Green and Low- Carbon Development Roadmap 1.0 de veloped under the supervision of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. If this materialises, it would be a decade ahead of the 50% sales in 2035 target laid out in the Energy-s aving and New Energy Vehicle Technology Roadmap 2.0 pub lished just a few years ago . Moreover, it would be well above the official target of 20% new energy car sales by 2025, and would even exceed the recently announced 45% NEV sales share target for 2027. After achieving this milestone, the sales share of electric cars and vans continues to grow in the STEPS, exceeding two- thirds of total sales in 2030 and almost reaching 85% in 2035. Given that the current trend is tracking ahead of government targets, the electric LDV sales shares are the same for STEPS and APS through 2035. However, it will be critical for China to roll out public charging infrastructure in a timely manner to enable such growth. Electric LDVs are generally cost-competitive in China even at purchase, and so the phasing out of EV purchase subsidies in 2023 is unlikely to affect further growth. Announced EV battery manufacturing capacity is well above projected sales share (see below), with an eye to potential exports, and so even higher shares are theoretically achievable. China is also the global leader in terms of electric share of the 2/3W fleet, with over one-third of all 2/3Ws being electric today, and is expected to remain the leader in electric 2/3W sales in both the STEPS and APS. In the STEPS, the sales share of electric 2/3Ws reaches nearly 90% in 2035; in the APS, the share is slightly above that by 2035. China also has one of the highest stock shares of electric buses, with more than one in four buses being electric. By 2035, the sales share of electric buses increases to over 70% in both scenarios, up from 50% in 2023.",

As such, in China there is no gap between existing policy frameworks and future targets, and even more ambition is conceivable. The European Union’s HDV CO2 standards brighten the outlook for electric heavy-duty vehicles Europe remains one of the most advanced EV markets under stated policies. Last year, the United Kingdom passed the Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes Order 2023, which mandates certain sales shares of zero- e mission cars and vans, setting a target for annual ZEV sales shares for cars to increase from 22% in 2024 to 80% in 2030. Considering the policy landscape across Europe, including the UK ZEV mandate and the EU CO2 standards for cars and vans , the sales share of electric LDVs in Europe reaches nearly 60% in 2030 and 85% in 2035 in the STEPS. The ZEV sales share in 2035 does not reach 100% for a couple of reasons. First, in the United Kingdom, the annual ZEV targets for 2031-2035 have not yet been set out in the legislation and thus the 100% ZEV sales target for 2035 is not reflected in the STEPS. Secondly, the European car market includes national markets that are not covered by such strong regulations as in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Given that the European Union has legislated to the level of its climate and EV ambitions (resulting in zero- emission LDV sales reaching 100% in 2035), and since the United Kingdom has also passed legislation for zero-emission LDVs, at least through 2030, the EV sales shares in the APS are similar to in the STEPS. Electric LDVs represent over 60% of sales in 2030 and over 90% of sales in 2035 in the APS. For buses and trucks, the revised EU HDV CO2 standards drive up electric HDV sales in the STEPS.",

Electric LDVs represent over 60% of sales in 2030 and over 90% of sales in 2035 in the APS. For buses and trucks, the revised EU HDV CO2 standards drive up electric HDV sales in the STEPS. The standards will require 100% of city bus sales to be zero- emission from 2035, and other HDVs to reduce CO 2 emissions by at least 45% in 2030, 65% in 2035 and 90% from 2040, compared to 2019 levels. A number of European countries also offer grants and other financial support for the purchase of electric buses and trucks. For example, the second round of Zer o Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA ) f unding in the United Kingdom is expected to add an additional 955 zero-emission buses to the UK fleet. In the STEPS, the sales shares of electric buses and trucks reach around 65% and 35% in 2035 in Europe. Within the European Union, sales are higher, reaching shares of 80% for buses and around 50% for trucks in 2035. The APS takes into account the ambitions of the 18 European national governments who have signed the Global M OU on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, committing to reach 30% zero-emission HDV sales shares in 2030 and 100% in 2040.

From 2026, California’s Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, which have been adopted by twelve other states and Washington DC,27 will begin to further increase zero- emission PLDV sales, with the stated aim of reaching 100% by 2035. Combined, these states represent around one-third of light-duty vehicle sales in the United States, with a significant impact on overall electric car sales and, therefore, on OEM strategy. This could create a ripple effect across the wider market, as OEMs harmonise around the regulations in order to bring down production costs through standardisation. In addition, in March 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also released the final rulemaking for Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light -Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles, which it estimates could bring electric PLDV sales to around 70% of total sales in 2032. The United States is also supporting an expansion of charging infrastructure to support increased EV adoption. At the end of 2023, construction of the first EV chargers funded under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure programme had begun, with around USD 100 million already awarded to projects. There is now around USD 2.5 billion available to states to be allocated to EV charging projects (about 60% of the total programme funding). The policy landscape in the United States, combined with already -committed industry investments (see below), is boosting confidence in EV market expansion. As a result, electric LDV sales reach approximately 55% in 2030 in the S TEPS, 27 The California Air Resources Board has requested a waiver from the US Environmental Protection Agency for the regulation to be enforceable; a waiver has not yet been granted. Given that such a waiver was granted for the previous Advanced Clean Cars regulation, this regulation is included in the STEPS.

Under stated policies, the US electric bus sales share is expected to increase from around 1% in 2023 to 35% in 2030 and 60% in 2035. With respect to trucks, 11 states, representing around one-quarter of HDV sales in the country, have adopted California’s Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, which sets ZEV sales requirements for trucks that range from 40- 75% in 2035. Bringing the national standards more in line with the Californian regulation, the US EPA finalised GHG standards for HDVs f or model years 2028 -2032, which aims to reduce emissions from trucks and heavy buses by 25-60% in 2032 compared to 2026. In the STEPS, the electric truck sales share across the United States reaches around 50% in 2035. The United States is also a signatory of the Global MOU, which targets 30% zero- emission M/HDV sales shares by 2030 (on aggregate, across bus and truck sales) and 100% by 2040. In the APS, the US electric bus sales share reaches around 75% in 2035 and the electric truck sales share reaches almost 70% in 2035. The EV sales share across all modes (excluding 2/3Ws) reaches more than 70% in both the STEPS and the APS in 2035. Japan’s policies in support of electric vehicles remain unchanged Japan has fuel economy standards for both light - and heavy-duty vehicles, and offers purchase subsidies for EVs. Historically, Japan has also had a relatively high sales share of hybrid (non-plug-in) vehicles, as one way to reduce emissions from cars and improve the average fuel economy. In the STEPS, the electric LDV sales share increases from about 3% in 2023 to around 20% in 2030, and 30% in 2035. In Japan’s Green Growth Strategy , the government sets a target for 100% of new car sales to be electrified by 2035 – for which their definition includes BEVs, PHEV, FCEV and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In the APS, which reflects this target, about 70% of LDV sales in 2035 are electric (BEV or PHEV). With respect to HDVs, electric bus sales reach about 25% in 2030 and increase to 50% in 2035 in the STEPS.

In India, the outlook for electric car sales brightens as domestic supply chains are built India’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) II scheme, which provided subsidies for EVs and funding for EV charging, ended on 31 March 2024. The Ministry of Heavy Industries announced in March 2024 a limited scheme for the period between 1 April 2024 and 31 July 2024, which outlays over INR 4.9 billion (Indian rupees) (almost USD 60 million) to subsidise electric 2/3W purchases. This may be a stopgap until the announcement of a FAME III scheme, which is expected to detail new subsidy provisions for EVs. In addition, the government’s Production Linked Incentive scheme for Automobile and Auto Components and for manufacturing of Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery Storage a im s to attract investments in domestic EV and battery manufacturing. Based on the current policy landscape, electric LDVs represent one in four LDVs sold in India in 2035. The APS takes into account that India signed the COP 2 6 declaration t o transition to 100% zero -emission LDV sales by 2040. As such, electric LDV sales in 2035 reach over 60% in the APS. India has the largest stock of two-wheelers of any country and represents almost 30% of the global stock of three- wheelers. Electrifying the 2/3W segment will therefore be important for decarbonising India’s road transport system. India has made good progress to date, and almost a quarter of the country’s three-wheelers are electric. The sales share of electric 2/3Ws increases from around 8% in 2023 to almost 60% in 2035 in the STEPS. In the APS the electric sales share reaches 70% in 2035. As announced at COP 28, India is aiming to reach a stock of 50 000 electric buses by 2027, backed by a USD 390 million fund supported by both the Indian and US governments to provide loans to expand electric bus manufacturing. In both the STEPS and the APS, electric bus sales shares increase to about 35% in 2030 and 60% in 2035. Electric truck sales remain low in both scenarios to 2035, at under 10%. Across all modes (including 2/3Ws), the EV sales share in India is about 50% in 2035 in the STEPS (and closer to 25% if 2/3Ws are excluded).

Many emerging and developing economies set their sights on electrification of two- and three-wheelers and public transport Each year, more and more countries around the world are setting out a clear vision or targets for electromobility. However, in emerging and developing economies, in particular, adoption of EVs can be hindered by limited funding available for fiscal incentives and other measures to overcome purchase price hurdles. Importantly, there are still some 750 million people without access to electricity , mainly in sub- Saharan Africa, and others with grid reliability issues, which also affects the prospects for charging EVs. However, efforts are being made to support governments in EMDEs to advance deployment of EVs, such as through the Global Electric Mobility Programme , as well as proposed reforms that could improve financing options from Multilateral Development Banks. In many EMDEs, the main targets of vehicle electrification initiatives are 2/3Ws and public transport. In Colombia, for example, there has been a major focus on electrifying mass transportation systems (buses), cargo vehicles and taxis. Targets for electric 2/3Ws have been set in countries as diverse as Cambodia, Morocco and the Dominican Republic. In the STEPS, the average EV sales share across regions and countries outside of those described in the preceding sections is about 45% for 2/3Ws, 20% for buses, 18% for LDVs and 3% for trucks in 2035. In the APS, sales across these other regions reach 65% of 2/3Ws, 40% of LDVs, 30% of buses and 10% of trucks. The countries that have adopted EV -related policies and set ambitions tend to have higher EV sales shares than these averages. In particular, Canada tends to align with the most ambitious standards in North America. In December 2023, Canada amended its GHG regulation s to include new requirements to increase the availability of zero-emission passenger cars and light trucks, targeting at least 20% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2026, at least 60% by 2030 and 100% zero- emission vehicle sales by 2035.

The industry outlook The ten largest carmakers are set to sell over 20 million electric cars in 2030, exceeding current policy targets As of 2023, the ten largest global automakers all have established clear electrification targets. Together, these automakers sold over 40 million cars in 2023, representing about 55% of global sales. Although some manufacturers have missed or postponed near -term targets – often pointing to underwhelming consumer demand – they have not scaled back their longer -term ambitions. If each company in the top ten meets their target, over 20 million new electric cars could be sold in 2030. Notable examples include BMW’s target of 50% of deliveries in 2030 to be BEVs; Toyota’s 3.5 million BEV sales target in 2030; Stellantis’s 5 million BEV sales target in 2030; and GM’s target of a global EV manufacturing capacity of 2 million per year by 2025.",

In addition, Tesla is targeting production of 20 million electric cars in 2030, which – combined with the targets of the top ten – would be roughly equivalent to the projected sales in the STEPS in that year. In total, more than 20 OEMs, together representing over 90% of car sales in 2023, have set some sort of target for future EV deployment. The global electric car sales envisaged in announcements by manufacturers have increased by several percentage points based on developments over the past year. If all manufacturers’ targets on vehicle electrification are combined, between 42% and 58% of car sales in 2030 could be electric. This range encompasses the sales share for cars in the STEPS (almost 45%) and the share implied by government ambitions in the APS (almost 50%). Regional examples include:  In China, major carmakers, including incumbents, have increased their electrification ambitions. For example, SAIC and Geely are targeting 50% NEV sales by 2025.  In Europe, more ambitious targets announced by majors such as Volkswagen, Ampere (a spin- out of Renault), Nissan and Suzuki have increased the overall OEM electrification targets relative to last year’s range. For example, Volkswagen increased its BEV delivery target from 70% to 80% by 2030. On the other hand, Mercedes-Benz has delayed its goal of 50% electrified car sales by 5 years, to 2030.  In the United States, both Ford and GM missed their 2023 targets or abandoned those for 2024, citing profitability concerns, though they are maintaining longer - term targets. Ford missed its targeted manufacturing rate of 600 000 EVs per year in 2023, but now aims to achieve that in 2024. GM had previously planned to manufacture 400 000 electric cars in North America by mid- 2024, but has now Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 118 IEA. CC BY 4.0. dropped that target, and yet has retained a US manufacturing capacity target of 1 million electric cars by 2025. Meanwhile, Volkswagen increased their BEV delivery target in the United States from 50% to 55% by 2030. As a result of missed near -term targets but robust longer -term ambition, the outlook for the United States based on OEM targets has remained stable over the past year.  In Japan too, new announcements have increased the aggregate OEM target range. Suzuki aims to reach 20% BEV sales in 2030.",

Policy is boosting investment in manufacturing capacity, building confidence for a rapid electrification pathway Battery and EV manufacturers have faced new challenges and opportunities as major markets including the United States and the European Union introduced new industrial policies. Domestic content requirements introduced by these policies have supported the expansion plans of major battery and EV manufacturers, with billions in investments already committed as of early 2024. Worldwide, reported investment announcements from 2022 and 2023 alone exceed USD 275 billion in EVs and USD 195 billion in batteries, with around USD 190 billion of the total already committed. The level of investments observed in the past 2 years boosts confidence in the electrification of road transport. In China, committed battery manufacturing capacity is well above what is needed to supply domestic electric car sales in 2030. In fact, just two-thirds of the already- committed battery cell manufacturing capacity would be sufficient to cover 100% of electric car sales in China in 2030. This excess capacity, which is today driving 28 Mercedez-Benz had previously announced the end of ICE car sales this decade but has recently delayed that target. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 120 IEA. CC BY 4.0. down margins, implies that battery producers are banking on export markets, at least in part. This will bring both opportunities and challenges. Countries that have electrification targets but lack sufficient battery manufacturing capacity could reach these targets through imports from China, whereas companies outside of China will see increased competition from the arrival of Chinese manufacturers. Governments will seek to find the right balance between supporting local producers at the same time as ensuring consumers can benefit from the low prices offered by Chinese manufacturers, which would accelerate road electrification. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) revised the requirements for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit.

From September 2022 to the end of 2023, after the IRA was signed into law, investments of more than USD 60 billion were announced to support the EV industry, in EV manufacturing, charging and batteries in the United States. 31 The vast majority – about 80% – of these investments are for batteries; with just around USD 5 billion announced for EVs, though there are, of course, strong links between battery manufacturing and EV manufacturing. For example, in February 2024, Volkswagen-backed Scout Motors started building a USD 2 billion electric sports utility vehicle ( SUV) manufacturing plant in South Carolina. In mid -2023, BMW broke ground on their high- voltage battery manufacturing plant (USD 700 million) to supply batteries for their announced EV production lines (USD 1 billion) in South Carolina. Hyundai-Kia, which in 2023 overtook GM and Ford in terms of electric car sales share, plans to manufacture EVs in the state of Georgia by October 2024 to qualify for IRA benefits. Announced battery manufacturing expansions in the United States, in part resulting from signals sent by the IRA, would be more than enough to satisfy carmaker electrification targets and government ambitions in 2030. Of course, the 29 The critical minerals requirement refers to minimum percentages of critical mineral extraction or processing (by values) in the United States or in a country which has a free trade agreement with the United States.

According to the Clean Investment Monitor , actual expenditures in EV battery manufacturing from 2020 to 2023 totalled around USD 45 billion. Around 45% of the capital expenditure ( CAPEX) needed for battery manufacturing has therefore already been spent. In the European Union, the Net Zero Industry Act and the subsequent relaxing of state aid rules in March 2023 are boosting public support for road transport electrification. For example, in January 2024 , Swedish battery maker Northvolt received approval for EUR 700 million in direct grant and EUR 200 million in guarantee from Germany, which was described as “proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary to trigger the investment in Europe”. Northvolt’s project is expected to require a total investment of EUR 4.5 billion, creating 3 000 jobs and starting battery manufacturing in 2026. The company also secured a USD 5 b illion green loan – t outed as the largest green loan in Europe to date – with the support of European and Korean banks and export credit agencies. The loan will enable further expansion for the production of cathodes, cell manufacturing and a recycling plant in northern Sweden. As of 2024, the market signals provided by the Net Zero Industry Act have been sufficient to attract enough committed investments in battery manufacturing capacity in the European Union to satisfy government electrification targets out to 2030. Across the whole of Europe, committed investments come close to meeting these targets. While investments that are already committed today tend to be more heavily geared towards battery than to EV manufacturing, it is important to note that battery manufacturing and EV expansion plans typically go hand in hand, often being situated close to demand centres to create integrated supply chains. This close collaboration is important in order to deliver on targets, avoid bottlenecks and decrease costs. In addition, in the event that committed EV battery manufacturing capacity outpaces demand from EV manufacturers, it is unlikely that it would find alternative outlets, as other key battery markets such as consumer electronics are already well supplied and have different technical specifications. Failure to deliver on EV manufacturing capacity and sales therefore creates a risk of massive sunk investment in battery manufactu ring, if manufacturers are unable to export significant quantities. 32 CAPEX of 2023 USD 107 million per GWh of battery manufacturing capacity is assumed.

Battery manufacturing capacity refers to the mobility sector only and assumes utilisation factors of 85%. Sources: IEA analysis based on companies announcements and data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, Bloomberg New Energy Finance and EV Volumes. For example, in Europe, Volkswagen benefits from close co-operation with two of the biggest regional battery manufacturers, LG Energy Solutions and Samsung, which together provide batteries for 95% of Volkswagen’s European electric car sales. In China, on the other hand, Volkswagen works with CATL, which provides almost all the batteries for its Chinese electric car sales. Similarly, Tesla works with Panasonic’s Nevada plant in the United States, but with CATL and LG Energy Solutions in China. When considering expansion plans, battery manufacturers often seek to bring operations closer to the production facilities of partner OEMs. CATL is currently developing manufacturing facilities in Hungary to provide regional car makers like Stellantis, which sources nearly 50% of its European EV batteries from CATL and the other half from LG and Samsung SDI. A similar trend is already observable outside of the biggest EV markets, such as in Türkiye, where the Turkish brand Togg and Farasis Energy created a joint venture in April 2023. During 2023 the Togg T10X model reached almost 20 000 registrations in Türkiye, becoming the fourth most sold car model in November 2023. Continued co-operation between EV and battery makers is expected to continue to support road transport electrification into the future.

Heavy-duty original equipment manufacturers are most ambitious in the European market, driven by proposed CO2 standards A few new announcements on zero- emission vehicle strategies have been seen in the HDV market, such as the agreement signed by Hino Motors Sales USA that could result in the delivery of up to 10 000 electric trucks by 2030. For the United States, the range of OEM targets in 2030 encompasses the zero-emission vehicle sales shares in the STEPS (around 20%). Chinese OEM Foton has also announced a target of 50% NEV sales by 2030. Similarly, BAIC Trucks also plans to sell 50% new energy trucks by 2030 and 80% by 2035. On aggregate, OEM targets would imply that zero -emission truck sales represent 13-32% of Chinese truck sales in 2030. There have been no big announcements from truck makers in Europe over the past year, but OEM targets for this market still exceed what would be necessary under the EU HDV CO 2 standard, as reflected in the STEPS sales share.

The figure compares OEM targets for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) (which for some OEMs include buses) relative to IEA projections for zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty truck sales (including fuel cell electric vehicles). Since annual sales of trucks substantially outnumber sales of buses, achieving HDV targets will requir e selling zero- emission trucks, which is currently more challenging than selling electric buses.

CC BY 4.0. 8. Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure Light-duty vehicle charging Public charging could increase sixfold by 2035, helping mass-market consumers switch to electric Large-scale adoption of EVs hinges on the simultaneous roll-out of accessible and affordable charging. The early adopters of electric cars have tended to live in single-family detached homes with affordable and convenient access to home charging. As a result, most charging to date has been private (at home and other private locations). At the same time, public chargers have tended to be installed in urban areas , where utilisation rates are likely to be higher. Looking forward, however, chargers must also be installed outside of urban areas to enable continued adoption beyond cities and suburbs. In a 2021 survey of EV drivers in the United Kingdom, over 90% of the respondents reported having access to home chargers, whereas a 2023 study showed that only 55% of Indian consumers had such access. The build -out of charging in workplaces and publicly accessible areas will be key for increasing adoption among groups without access to home charging. Charging speed – slow or fast – is also an important consideration for consumers looking to switch to electric, especially when considering a vehicle for long journeys. Charging services should also be easy to use, reliable and transparent ly priced. Further, ensuring interoperability is important when making investments in charging infrastructure and services, so that a wide customer base is able to benefit. In the STEPS and APS, the global number of public charging points exceeds 15 million by 2030, up four-fold compared to the almost 4 million operating in 2023. By 2035, this number reaches almost 25 million in the APS, a six fold increase relative to 2023. Among today’s major EV markets, China is where the population’s access to home charging is most limited and where public charging has been most widely rolled out as a result. China accounted for 70% of global public LDV charging in 2023 and is expected to remain a leader with a similar share in 2035 in the STEPS. While the current availability of public chargers in China already appears to be above the global average (<10 electric LDVs per public charging point), the government recently issued new guidelines for deploying high- quality charging Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure PAGE | 126 IEA.

Policies focused on charging infrastructure play an important role in increasing the number of charging points per EV. Specifically, the EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) requires member states to ensure publicly accessible charging stations offer in aggregate at least 1.3 kW of power output per BEV and 0.8 kW per PHEV. The capacity requirements can be relaxed once 15% battery electric stock share has been reached. In the APS, the average charging capacity per EV is close to 1 kW, despite over 80% of electric LDVs being battery electric, given that battery electric LDVs reach a 30% stock share.

Recommendations for EV charging concessions to implement the EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation Following the formal adoption of the EU AFIR in 2023, EU member states are now implementing the regulation through the public and private entities that operate European motorway networks. This process is helping to build up the knowledge base on how to ensure that reliable charging points are deployed quickly and effectively through competitive tendering, thereby fostering the emerging market for EV charging infrastructure. Key learnings include: 1 – Collect information on state-of-the-art technologies and designs prior to issuing the tender Carrying out a market consultation with charging point operators (CPOs) ahead of publishing a tender can help to ensure that the tenders are designed to encourage bids that follow best practices and use the latest technologies in this emerging sector. 2 – Include station design and reliability in the evaluation criteria of a tender Tender evaluations should consider other criteria alongside rent (i.e. the amount that the CPO pays to operate the station), to ensure that CPOs also score highly on other factors relevant to the offer to customers. Tenders should include criteria to ensure that EV charging stations are well designed and easily accessible. This includes making sure that charging stations have sufficient space to accommodate EVs of different sizes , including HDV s, camper vans and vehicles with caravans, as well as users with limited mobility, so that drivers are not required to perform potentially dangerous manoeuvres. Criteria can also be designed to ensure that chargers can service the newest generation of BEVs, as well as older models, and that sites have the potential to expand as the EV market increases. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure PAGE | 129 IEA. CC BY 4.0. For successful long -term operation and ensuring EV drivers are not dissuaded, CPOs need to be held accountable for providing a reliable service. Competitive tenders should set criteria for quality, with penalties for those that do not meet required standards, for example 99% uptime and regular charger maintenance. Further, selection criteria can be used to ensure chargers are smart-ready, able to share data within the charging ecosystem, provide fair and transparent pricing, and meet interoperability obligations. 3 – Bundle more and less desirable sites to ensure full coverage Charging stations located at sites with higher traffic often have a higher utilisation rate and thus are more profitable than those with lower traffic.",

In order to prevent CPOs from only bidding on the most desirable locations, tenders can bundle the motorway locations into several “lots” composed of higher- and lower-traffic sites. 4 – Ensure tender terms provide a viable business case Given that the EV market is still relatively nascent, many EV charging stations will not be profitable for a number of years. ChargeUp Europe, an industry association, recommends that a contract duration of at least 15 years is necessary for CPOs to recover initial investments and for sites to become profitable. In general, the lower the current EV stock share, the longer the tender terms should be for CPOs to feel confident in the business proposition. Further, to best enable CPOs to assess the business case for a tender, only one CPO should be selected to serve each service area, as is the case with conventional petrol stations. The presence of multiple CPOs makes it very difficult to predict revenues given low EV penetration rates. Different CPOs could be selected on consecutive service areas to provide greater customer choice and market competition. Local monopolies should be avoided. 5 – Prepare grid connections Establishing a grid connection can be a lengthy, complex process, which can delay development of charging stations . To overcome this potential hurdle, motorway operators can request grid connections in advance of or in parallel to issuing a tender. Governments can also set requirements for grid operators to respond to requests within a set time and ensure there are no conflicts of interest between grid operators and parties requesting grid connections . In countries where grid operators also operate as CPOs, they can be in direct competition with operators requesting connections.

The share of public charging is expected to grow in the next decade, though most charging will still take place at home Statistics on the availability of home chargers are scattered, and our analysis therefore assumes that access to home charging covers 50 -80% of the electric LDV fleet, based on various surveys, depending on the share of population residing in dense urban areas. 33 We estimate that globally there were 27 million home chargers in operation in 2023, or 150 GW of charging capacity and 1.6 electric LDVs per home charger. The stock grows more than tenfold by 2035 in the STEPS to reach over 270 million. In the APS, the home charger stock reaches around 300 million in 2035.",

The stock of other private chargers increases up to 14- fold by 2035 in the APS, while public chargers increase sixfold. In both scenarios, the charging capacity offered by public chargers in 2035 is higher than that offered by private chargers outside of homes. In total, there are an estimated 1.2 electric LDVs per charging point, including public and private, 2035 in the APS, up from just over 1 in 2023. Even with access to home charging, EV owners rely t o some extent on public charging. As EV adoption broadens, the share of charging from other private or public charging stations (in terms of electricity delivered to vehicles) is expected to grow over time.

CC BY 4.0. Heavy-duty vehicle charging As more and more buses and trucks are electrified, charging capacity is set to grow twenty-fold by 2035 For commercial vehicle operators, similarly to owners of personal EVs, overnight charging of electric HDVs at depots offers a convenient way to charge stationary vehicles. Charging overnight also has the benefit of being able to charge at relatively low power rates given the amount of time available. This kind of charging strategy requires a close to one-to-one ratio of depot charger per electric HDV. In the near term, it is expected that electrification of HDVs will proceed most quickly for segments with relatively short (under 200 km/day), predictable daily routes, such as city buses, urban and even some regional delivery services. Overnight depot charging could likely meet most of the needs of these fleets. In addition, there will also be a role for opportunity chargers. Opportunity chargers can be at the end of a bus line or at a truck loading dock, where vehicles can take advantage of waiting time to charge without disrupting typical operations. Opportunity chargers also include public chargers along motorways that allow for en-route charging.",

Opportunity chargers can be at the end of a bus line or at a truck loading dock, where vehicles can take advantage of waiting time to charge without disrupting typical operations. Opportunity chargers also include public chargers along motorways that allow for en-route charging. For some HDVs, such as intercity buses and long-haul trucks, en-route fast charging may be needed to supplement depot charging in order to enable long-distance driving. While these segments could be slower to electrify, their relatively high share of activity today – and thus emissions – mean they will be important to decarbonise. Options other than wired charging could also be used to support electric HDVs, such as electric road systems and battery swapping. In China in particular, battery swapping for trucks may become a widespread means of recharging. However, the current analysis of charger needs does not take into account non -wired charging options, as the future role of these alternative technologies remains uncertain.

Heavy-duty vehicle charger stock and capacity in the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges Scenarios, 2023-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario. Charger stock in 2023 is estimated based on the number of electric buses and trucks. In the STEPS, over 99% of HDV chargers are depot chargers in 2030, though about 10% of electricity is provided by opportunity chargers . By 2035, there is greater deployment and utilisation of opportunity chargers, with the stock more than tripling compared to 2030 to reach 100 000 in 2035. In total, the installed capacity of chargers for HDVs reaches 2 000 GW in 2035 in the APS. For reference, the installed global renewable electricity capacity in 2022 was around 3 600 GW. Despite the average capacity of an opportunity charger being assumed to be around four times as high as a depot charger (especially considering the role of MW-scale charging), less than 5% of the total installed capacity for heavy-duty chargers in 2035 is from opportunity chargers. Policy has an important role to play in fostering infrastructure roll -out. The EU AFIR, for example, includes requirements for coverage of HDV charging points with a power output of at least 350 kW along TEN-T Network by the end of 2025. In March 2024, the United States released the National Zero- Emission Freight Corridor Strategy, which aims to guide infrastructure deployment, catalyse public and private investment; and support utility and regulatory planning and action at local, state and regional levels. As of the end of 2023, cumulative private investment in medium - and heavy -duty vehicle charging infrastructure in the United States amounted to USD 4.2 billion. Industry will certainly also play a major role in HDV charging infrastructure development. For example, joint venture Milence plans to build and operate 1 700 HDV charging points in Europe by 2027.",

Special focus: examining the impacts of ramping up heavy-duty charging on power grids A key challenge for rolling out charging infrastructure is ensuring that it can provide secure, low -emissions and affordable electricity. Decision makers will need to assess the impacts of HDV charging on the expansion and operation of power systems, and t o plan accordingly. In this section, we explore the implications of different HDV charging strategies for power systems, through an analysis at the bulk power system level for three regions (China, the European Union and the United States) and a case study of a local high-voltage grid. We also discuss some strategies and technologies to mitigate the impacts of HDV charging on power grids. EV charging creates both challenges and opportunities for electricity systems. Beyond local issues such as variations in power quality (e.g. harmonic distortion), EV charging can have an impact on electricity systems, mainly via demand-supply imbalances, either locally (e.g. by causing grid congestion) or – if there is a large enough fleet – at the system level. The electricity system impacts of EV charging can be principally understood by a combination of three dimensions: the when (at what time and for how long), the where (in which location of the grid), and the how much (the charging power that the vehicle is using). As an example, EV charging could create stress on the electricity system if it takes place in an area of the grid that is already congested at that time. On the other hand, charging could become a beneficial opportunity if it is possible to charge the fleet at a different time of the day, when there is less congestion or greater renewable power availability, or if it is possible to charge in a different location. This analysis is based on four cases that only differ with regards to the charging location and the power availability. There is no difference in technical parameters such as battery size or average daily mileage. All these cases represent feasible ways of meeting heavy-duty truck charging needs with different charging location options.  Case 1.",

Heavy-duty trucks charge exclusively overnight at the depot, with a nominal capacity of 50 kW per charging point.  Case 2.

With the same behavioural profile, charging power stands at 1 MW instead of 350 kW.

The values plotted are based on a simulation of 1 000 trucks over 24 hours using the IEA Electric Vehicle Charging and Grid Integration Tool. Fleet behaviour is represented by assuming that vehicles arrive, stay and depart at different times because of the underlying probabilistic distribution, resulting in a charging profile that is not fully simultaneous for all vehicles in the fleet. As part of the simulation inputs, it was assumed that each truck has a battery capacity of 500 kWh, consumes 1.4 kWh/km and travels 300 +/- 50 km per day. 34 This case reflects EU regulations that require drivers to take a break of at least 45 minutes every 4.5 hours. 0 6 12 18 24 Hour Depot Destination (loading dock) En route 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 6 12 18 24 MW Hour 0 6 12 18 24 Hour Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 - 1 MW 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 6 12 18 24 MW Hour Case 3 - 350 kW Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure PAGE | 135 IEA.

CC BY 4.0. Daytime charging could support solar PV integration Electric truck charging adds to electricity demand from other end uses and can have a significant impact on the average daily load curve, depending on the structure of the underlying demand. For instance, in 2035 in the APS, the United States has an evening peak resulting in part from the charging of passenger cars, while in the European Union and China, midday demand is high because of significant industry consumption. Across regions, the largest impacts by 2035 in the APS are in the European Union and the United States, where demand from electric trucks accounts for around 3% of total electricity demand. In China, truck charging has less of an impact on total electricity demand profiles in the APS (less than 1% by 2035), as other sectors such as industry play a much larger role. Different charging behaviours can lead to peaks in total system power demand at different times throughout the day. Overnight charging at truck depots increases night-time demand and limits daily load variations, smoothing the truck charging load curve. Opportunity charging (at the loading dock) or en-route charging shifts power demand to the daytime, potentially creating new peaks in consumption. MW-scale chargers reduce charging times, producing high demand spikes that can be challenging for local grids. Fast chargers reinforce afternoon peaks, potentially overtaking the typical evening peak from residential consumers and passenger car charging. Different charging approaches also lead to different results in terms of how well they support the integration of renewables. Daytime charging can more directly support solar PV integration, as loading dock or en- route charging increases demand between midday and the afternoon, when solar PV production is high, and electricity prices are potentially low. Increasing daytime power demand via charging could facilitate balancing supply and demand at the system level, and reduce the need for measures such as curtailment to manage excesses in solar PV output. Daytime charging can also be directly coupled with solar through the installation of solar panels on the roofs of charging depots . In contrast, while overnight charging at truck depots may (at times) coincide with high wind output, and could potentially benefit users if electricity prices are low at night, it does not directly contribute to solar PV integration.

Fast charging during the day could reduce the need for power system flexibility in the evening Fast daytime charging of electric heavy -duty trucks could reduce the need for electricity system flexibility35 in the early evening – typically the most challenging period of the day in terms of power system operation. In the early evening, demand from several end uses tends to increase quickly, precisely when solar PV supply declines at sunset. As a result, the net load (i.e. total demand minus generation from solar PV and wind) ramps up, requiring higher short-duration flexibility – a need that will become all the more important as the share of solar PV increases in the overall system. This flexibility can be met by several sources, including dispatchable generation units, storage, or demand response. Additional flexibility needs can lead to operational challenges and higher costs, as maintaining a precise balance of electricity supply and demand requires either the use of power plants that have ramp-up constraints and start-up costs, or other measures that each have their own limitations (such as the state of charge of energy storage) and costs.

MW-scale truck charging could lead to notable hikes in the utilisation rates of local grids Drawing from these case studies of HDV charging patterns, grid simulation techniques can be used to examine the possible impacts on the grid, considering the time and location of various loads and generation units. The impacts on local grids will vary greatly depending on the particularities of each system. However, our analysis, based on a simulated local high-voltage grid, suggests that greater use of daytime fast charging for heavy trucks can result in significantly higher utilisation rates of power lines. This highlights the need for anticipatory grid investment planning, and for consideration of available grid- hosting capacities to deploy and operate HDV charging stations without putting security and affordability at risk. In our analysis, fast daytime charging, particularly MW -scale charging, would be the main driver of investments in the grid (although overnight charging may also necessitate grid upgrades).

Not only can it help with co- ordinating supply and demand at the system level, but it can also help send adequate locational signals that ensure that local constraints are respected, and that charging takes place during the best moments for the system. In the specific case of HDVs, smart chargi ng schemes at overnight depots can help ensure that the flexibility opportunity provided by the long charging window can be exploited as much as possible. Similarly, smart charging can incentivise drivers at loading docks or en- route chargers to either maximise or minimise their use of the charger, leaving space to complete the charge later at the depot if needed. Several other measures can reduce the impacts of fast charging, and even provide additional grid services. While grid upgrades will be necessary in many cases, other solutions such as electric road systems can be of great help. Measures such as battery swapping can also reduce strain on grids by charging replacement batteries over longer timeframes, reducing the peak power needs. Alternatively, co-located stationary batteries and/or renewable generators can enable the CPO to meet some of their own charging needs. This can combine the advantages of intra-day charging using solar energy, which can be used to charge the stationary batteries, and night discharge to reduce power grid load, where trucks can be charged using the stationary batteries. Additionally, these assets could be used to provide grid services such as energy arbitrage or frequency regulation (provided that the regulatory framework supports it), which can enhance the profitability of such projects. The business cases of each of these measures must be carefully assessed to decide which solution (or set of solutions) could be cheapest for each charging station and for the system. Co-ordinated, anticipatory measures will be essential to balance the bulk power system benefits of fast charging with local grid impacts This analysis highlights the need to consider multiple aspects for the smooth roll- out of HDV charging infrastructure, in particular, but also all charging infrastructure in general, including:  Co-ordinated charging infrastructure development : collaborative planning between stakeholders such as policy makers, utilities, system fleet managers and CPOs can optimise system development and reduce costs, particularly as fast charging could create a need for network upgrades in different segments of the grid.  Data-gathering: A careful study of the driving patterns of heavy -duty trucks will be essential to inform the best possible roll -out and operation of HDV charging infrastructure.",

CC BY 4.0. attractiveness of industrial areas along the TEN -T. This can help build understanding not only of charging needs, but also the opportunities for flexibility in charging behaviour.  Strategic and integrated power grid planning: as grid upgrades and expansion can have long lead times, anticipatory planning using authoritative scenarios that also consider the needs of other sectors will be crucial to avoid power grids becoming a bottleneck for the adequate deployment and operation of charging infrastructure. Grid capacities must be considered when choosing a location and designing the installed capacity of chargers. In cases where network congestion is an issue, non-firm connections could possibly serve as a complementary solution to grid reinforcement.  Co-ordinated and smart charging across vehicle types: given that there are trade-offs between daytime and overnight charging, implementing smart charging can help balance benefits, such as renewable integration and reduced system flexibility needs, with the mitigation of stress on the power grids. This can also help avoid unintended events like ‘herd’ behaviour – such as when all vehicles are charged at night, causing significant grid impacts. Market design (such as time- varying tariffs) to signal where and when it is best to charge to minimise system impacts, the readiness of smart charging infrastructure, and data-sharing between stakeholders, will be vital enablers.  Local solutions for managing local challenges: deploying technologies such as stationary batteries in charging stations, battery swapping, or on-site renewable power plants can reduce stress on the grids and help integrate fast charging, thereby benefiting users. Some of these options can also provide additional services to the power system beyond demand management. In many cases, these solutions have the additional advantage of shorter deployment lead times than grid expansions, and may also be cheaper overall.

Outlook for battery and energy demand Battery demand Battery demand for electric vehicles jumps tenfold in ten years in a net zero pathway As EV sales continue to increase in today’s major markets in China, Europe and the United States, as well as expanding across more countries, demand for EV batteries is also set to grow quickly. In the STEPS, EV battery demand grows four- and-a-half times by 2030, and almost seven times by 2035 compared to 2023. In the APS and the NZE Scenario, demand is significantly higher, multiplied by five and seven times in 2030 and nine and twelve times in 2035, respectively. To put this in context, in the APS in 2035, there could be as much EV battery demand per week as there was in the entire year of 2019. Cars remain the primary driver of EV battery demand, accounting for about 75% in the APS in 2035, albeit down from 90% in 2023, as battery demand from other EVs grows very quickly. In the STEPS, battery demand for EVs other than cars jumps eightfold by 2030 and fifteen-fold by 2035. In the APS, these numbers reach tenfold by 2030 and more than twenty -fold by 2035. Battery requirements differ across modes, with a 2/3W requiring a battery about 20 times smaller than a BEV, while buses and trucks require batteries that are between 2 and 5 times bigger than for a BEV. This also affects trends in different regions, given that 2/3Ws are significantly more important in emerging economies than in developed economies. As EVs increasingly reach new markets, battery demand outside of today’s major markets is set to increase. In the STEPS, China, Europe and the United States account for just under 85% of the market in 2030 and just over 80% in 2035, down from 90% today. In the APS, nearly 25% of battery demand is outside today’s major markets in 2030, particularly as a result of greater demand in India, Southeast Asia, South America, Mexico and Japan. In the APS in 2035, this share increases to 30%. Stationary storage will also increase battery demand, accounting for about 400 GWh in STEPS and 500 GWh in APS in 2030, which is about 12% of EV battery demand in the same year in both the STEPS and the APS.

Road transport electrification is opening significant opportunities for battery supply chains, including in emerging markets Battery production has been ramping up quickly in the past few years to keep pace with increasing demand. In 2023, battery manufacturing reached 2.5 TWh, adding 780 GWh of capacity relative to 2022. The capacity added in 2023 was over 25% higher than in 2022. Looking forward, investors and carmakers have been fleshing out ambitious plans for manufacturing expansion, confident that demand for EV and stationary batteries will continue to grow as a result of increasing electrification and power grid decarbonisation. Global battery manufacturing capacity by 2030, if announcements are completed in full and on time, could exceed 9 TWh by 2030, of which about 70% is already operational or otherwise committed. When assuming a maximum utilisation rate of 85% , this translates to the potential for almost 8 TWh of batteries to be produced in 2030, of which over 5.5 TWh is from plants already operational today and those with committed announcements. This level of production would be sufficient to meet global deployment needs in the APS and over 90% of the deployment needs in the NZE Scenario by 2030.

Companies operating in these regions will, however, need to scale up production rapidly and demonstrate that they are cost-competitive in order to satisfy all or a large share of their domestic demand. About 70% of the 2030 projected battery manufacturing capacity worldwide is already operational or committed, that is, projects have reached a final investment decision and are starting or begun construction, though announcements vary across regions. This encouraging signal from the battery industry indicates that it is ready to produce the batteries needed to achieve road transport electrification and stationary storage targets in full. Over 40% of announced manufacturing capacity in China relies on the expansion of current plants, indicating the strengthening of industrial actors that are already part of the Chinese market. Elsewhere, 80% of announced US and EU manufacturing capacity is expected to come from new plants, with a significant number of new actors entering those markets in the coming years. The announced manufacturing capacity outside of China, the European Union and the United States, of which 85% is already committed, together with today’s capacity, can meet almost half of APS needs in 2030 in these other regions . Almost all the committed manufacturing capacity is divided among other European countries and Canada (about 35% each), India (12%), other Southeast Asian countries (8%), particularly Viet Nam, Malaysia and Singapore, and Japan and Korea (5%). Korea and Japan, however, also account for over 80% of today’s capacity in these regions. There is significant space for growth in South American countries, which today have no significant announced battery manufacturing capacity by 2030, and in countries with manufacturing capacity that falls short of their pledges, such as India, whose announced capacity would cover only a quarter of its demand in the APS.

The evolution of battery chemistries and technology innovation will also have an impact on the recycling landscape of 2030. Of the two principal battery chemistries of today, nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP), the former is particularly well suited for recycling because it contains greater quantities of valuable metals. In contrast, LFP batteries have a lower residual value after recycling, which could put pressure on recycling business models. Nonetheless, regulations can fill this gap by either incentivising or mandating the recycling of end-of-life batteries regardless of their residual value. This is already the case for lead- acid batteries used in ICEVs, which have significantly lower residual values compared to any ty pe of lithium -ion battery but whose recycling rate can be up to almost 100% thanks to regulation. The lower residual value of LFP makes recycling uneconomical in Europe and the United States today, but LFP recycling is already economical in China, even though this is strongly affected by the market price for lithium. In this regard, the Chinese recycling industry is preparing to build sufficient LFP recycling capacity to meet future demand.",

Electricity demand Electric vehicles could account for 6-8% of total electricity demand by 2035, up from 0.5% today Charging an increasing number of EVs globally will require more electricity, and the share of EVs in total electricity consumption is expected to increase significantly as a result. In 2023, the global EV fleet consumed about 130 TWh of electricity – roughly the same as Norway’s total electricity demand in the same year. Zooming out to the global scale, EVs accounted for about 0.5% of the world’s total final electricity consumption in 2023, and around 1% in China and Europe. The contribution of different EV segments to electricity demand varies by region. For example, in 2023 in China, electric 2/3Ws and buses combined accounted for almost 30% of EV electricity demand, while in the United States , electric cars represented over 95% of EV electricity demand.

For the NZE Scenario, only global values are reported. Regional data can be interactively explored via the Global EV Data Explorer. Looking forward to 2035, EV electricity demand could reach nearly 2 200 TWh in the STEPS. In the APS, demand could be higher, standing at about 2 700 TWh in 2035, or over 20% more than in the STEPS, although the stock of EVs would be only around 15% higher. Several factors contribute to the disproportionate increase in EV electricity demand between the STEPS and APS. In the APS, rates of electrification are higher in markets where the average vehicle mileage is high, such as the United States. The APS also sees greater electrification for trucks and buses, which contribute incrementally to vehicle stock while pushing up electricity consumption and mileage, resulting in greater electricity demand per vehicle.",

    "text": "Several factors contribute to the disproportionate increase in EV electricity demand between the STEPS and APS. In the APS, rates of electrification are higher in markets where the average vehicle mileage is high, such as the United States. The APS also sees greater electrification for trucks and buses, which contribute incrementally to vehicle stock while pushing up electricity consumption and mileage, resulting in greater electricity demand per vehicle. In countries with net zero pledges, the APS assumes that a greater share of the distance covered by PHEVs will be driven in full electric mode, thereby requiring more electricity and less gasoline or diesel. This is particularly relevant for cars and vans, which account for more than two- thirds of demand in both the STEPS and the APS. By 2035, EV electricity demand accounts for less than 10% of global final electricity consumption in both the STEPS and APS. As shown in the World Energy Outlook 2023 , the share of electricity for EVs in 2035 remains small in comparison to demand for industrial applications, appliances, or heating and cooling. Further, the electrification of road transport results in overall reductions in energy consumption, given that electric powertrains are more efficient than internal combustion engines. Total road energy demand in the APS decreases by 10% in 2035 compared to 2023, despite road activity (vehicle kilometres travelled) increasing 20%. 2023 2030 2035 2030 2035 2030 2035 STEPS APS NZE China Europe United States India Japan Rest of the world 0 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500 4 000 2023 2030 2035 2030 2035 2030 2035 STEPS APS NZE TWh LDV Two/three-wheeler Bus Truck By mode By region Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for battery and energy demand PAGE | 150 IEA.

As the fleet grows, careful planning of electricity infrastructure, peak load management and smart charging should be priorities for near-term decision-making. Effective management of fast charging, in particular, will be needed to allow for optimal planning and resilience of power systems and to mitigate peak power demand. In both the STEPS and APS, over 80% of the electricity demand for electric LDVs in 2035 is met with slow chargers. To support policy -making and help countries prioritise charging strategies according to the size of their EV fleet and power system configuration, the IEA has developed a guiding framework and online tool for EV grid integration. Oil displacement Electric vehicle uptake means oil demand for road transport is set to peak around 2025 and displace 12 mb/d by 2035 Growing EV stocks reduce the need for oil. Globally, the projected EV fleet displaces 6 million barrels per day (mb/d) of diesel and gasoline in 2030, a sixfold increase on displacement in 2023. By 2035, even less oil is needed for road Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for battery and energy demand PAGE | 151 IEA. CC BY 4.0. transport, with displacement reaching 11 mb/d in the STEPS and 12 mb/d in the APS. In fact, we expect global demand for oil-based road transport fuels to peak around 2025. Displacement is largely attributed to electric LDVs, followed by trucks, buses and 2/3Ws.37 In particular, it will be important to closely track the uptake of electric 2/3Ws and their role in oil displacement: electric 2/3Ws may displace active modes of travel such as walking or cycling, rather than just fossil -powered transport, which is the assumption underpinning the STEPS and APS. This highlights that while EVs are an important component of transport decarbonisation, they are far from being the only one.

Oil displacement is based on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle fuel consumption to cover the same mileage as the EV fleet. Oil displacement is calculated by assuming that the distance (total kilometres) travelled by EVs by segment each year would have been otherwise travelled by ICE vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In the case of PHEVs – where the powertrain uses both oil -based fuel and electricity, only the distance covered by electricity is included. This method of estimation assumes that EVs replace ICE or hybrid vehicles of the same segment, and that these vehicles follow the same driving behaviour.

There is some evidence to suggest that EVs are driven further than their ICE counterparts, for example.

The shift to EVs may 37 As reported in the Global EV Outlook 2023, assumptions about which mode(s) of transport are displaced by electric 2/3W trips can greatly impact the resulting oil displacement.

Indeed, the rates of taxation per kilometre driven by EVs are lower than for their fossil fuel equivalents. In 2023, EVs displaced almost USD 12 billion in gasoline and diesel tax revenues globally. Meanwhile, the use of EVs generated close to USD 2 billion in electricity tax revenue, resulting in a net loss of USD 10 billion. As the stock of EVs (including 2/3Ws) is projected to grow globally to 460 million by 2030 in the STEPS and nearly 500 million in the APS, net tax revenue losses are set to increase by more than 5 times in the STEPS and APS.

Longer-term measures to stabilise tax revenues will be needed in the transition to electromobility. Policy strategies could involve more wide- ranging tax reforms, such as coupling high taxes on carbon -intensive fuels with distance- based charges. For example, Israel recently approved a new usage tax on kilometres travelled, which will apply to EVs as a way to compensate for lost revenues from excise duty on gasoline and diesel. Road tolls could charge users of road infrastructure. When used in city areas, tolls could also reduce traffic congestion, noise pollution and road infrastructure damage, while encouraging the uptake of alternative modes such as public transport, walking and cycling. Further, the EV transition can also bring monetary benefits due to health improvements associated with reductions in air pollution, for example by reducing health expenditures, preventing premature deaths and avoiding workdays lost due to illness. A study of the benefits of electric cars in Shanghai estimated that benefits exceed USD 6 000 per EV when replacing an average Chinese ICE V. About 40% of this monetary benefit is attributed to health benefits , and the remainder to climate benefits. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for emissions reductions PAGE | 154 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 10.

In the STEPS, the emissions avoided by using EVs rather than ICE equivalents (alongside continued improvements to ICE fuel economy) reach over 2 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) in 2035. Additional emissions f rom electricity generation for EVs are far smaller, at over 380 Mt CO2-eq, meaning there is a net saving of 1.8 Gt CO2-eq in 2035 in the STEPS . Sustained decarbonisation of power generation helps deliver even more emission reductions in the APS, in which net emissions avoided by switching to electric reach around 2 Gt CO 2-eq in 2035. However, there remains a substantial ambition gap between announced pledges and what would be required to put the world on a path consistent with the NZE Scenario. This is especially true in the near term: in 2030, 40% more emissions are avoided in the NZE Scenario compared to the APS, in which only around 5% more emissions are avoided than in the STEPS. By 2035, the gap between the NZE Scenario and APS emissions savings narrows to less than a 35% difference. At the same time, the APS net emissions reductions increase to over 10% relative to the STEPS. Current policies are not aligned with a net zero by 2050 pathway, and nor are announced pledges, calling for greater ambition in policy and corporate decision-making. Chinese passenger LDVs alone accounted for about 35% of global road transport avoided emissions in 2023, an important reminder of the benefits of switching to electric sooner rather than later to unlock greater cumulative CO 2 benefits. As other segments and regions catch up, this share falls to 25% in 2035 in the STEPS. By 2035, trucks account for almost 15% of avoided emissions globally, and buses nearly 5%. Early adoption of electric 2/3Ws meant that they accounted for almost 10% of avoided emissions in 2023.

These emissions savings increase by around 5 percentage points in the APS, as the grid decarbonises more quickly than in the STEPS. When comparing vehicles purchased in 2035, an ICE car produces almost two- and-a-half times the emissions of a battery electric car in the STEPS, and over three times as many in the APS, over the vehicle lifetime. For a medium -sized car, this equates to 38 t CO 2-eq over the ICE car lifetime compared to 15 t CO2-eq for a BEV.38 Power grid decarbonisation around the world is crucial for maximising the environmental benefit of BEVs. In terms of global averages for medium -size vehicles sold in 2023, well-to-tank emissions decrease by 25% to 35% thanks to electricity emissions intensity improvements foreseen in the STEPS and APS. For vehicles purchased in 2035, well -to-tank emissions decrease by 55% (in the STEPS) and 75% (APS) thanks to grid decarbonisation, as the emissions intensity of electricity generation drops 50- 65% between 2023 and 2035. However, even without these improvements, BEV emissions would still be about 30% lower than those from ICEVs. Grid decarbonisation in the APS also causes emissions from battery production to fall by about 10% by 2035. Vehicle size also plays an important role in determining lifecycle emissions. Many consumers are choosing larger vehicles than previously, prompted in part by model availability. Though smaller vehicles are clearly preferable in terms of both production and operation emissions across powertrains, the greater efficiency of an electric powertrain means electrification mitigates much of the negative impact of larger vehicles. While some large ICE SUVs can emit up to 50% more emissions than a medium-sized ICE car, a large battery electric SUV emits only around 20% more than a medium-sized battery electric car over its lifetime.

This analysis assumes that the utility factor (share of kilometres travelled on electricity) of PHEVs is 40%. 39 Greater lifecycle emissions savings can be achieved if the utility factor is higher. In fact, the rated utility factor for PHEVs with range of 60 km is around 65%. However, analysis from the past few years has shown that the real -world utility factor is significantly lower than the official values from vehicle type approvals (such as the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure). The European Commission published a report finding that the real- world CO2 emissions from PHEVs were on average 3.5 times higher than the laboratory values. A main factor behind this discrepancy is that PHEVs are not charged and driven in full electric mode as frequently as assumed. A separate study has suggested that the real - world utility factor is lower for company cars compared to privately owned cars, because those vehicles tend to be charged less frequently. Increasing PHEV charging and the use of the battery mode would result in greater reduct ions in emissions, but such measures are difficult to enforce.

The potential for emissions savings from BEVs is relatively high in the United States, thanks to the high annual mileage of cars and projected rapid power grid decarbonisation. The emissions intensity of the US average grid mix falls by 70% by 2035 in the STEPS. As a result, the lifecycle emissions of a BEV purchased in the United States today are around 45%, 60%, and 65% lower than those of a PHEV, HEV and ICEV. Compared to the ICEV, this amounts to a net lifetime savings almost 50 t CO 2-eq for a medium-sized BEV. In the United Kingdom, annual mileage is lower than in the United States – and closer to the global average – and, as a result, the lifetime emissions savings for a battery electric car compared to an ICE car amount to less than 20 t CO2-eq per vehicle. The average annual mileage in India is broadly similar to the United Kingdom, but the emissions intensity of power generation is higher , given a high use of coal. As result, BEV lifecycle emissions are similar to PHEV and HEV (<10% difference), and just 20% lower than ICEV. Thus, a battery electric car in India saves less than 10 tonnes of CO 2-eq over its lifetime compared to an ICE medium-sized car. However, it is worth noting that there are significant efforts to decarbonise electricity generation in the country: the emissions intensity of the grid falls to 60% of today’s level by 2035 in the STEPS. The environmental benefit of road electrification in India will therefore increase rapidly in the next years. Even today, electrification can already offer impor tant public health advantages by decreasing air pollution in India’s mega cities, like Mumbai. In China, BEV emissions are about 20%, 30%, and 40% lower compared to PHEV, HEV and ICEV, respectively, equivalent to almost 5 tonnes of CO2-eq (compared to a PHEV) and up to 10 ( compared to an ICEV) for a medium -sized vehicle. Despite the emissions benefits of BEVs being lower in China than in Europe and the United States, its larger battery electric car fleet – over 16 million vehicles compared to over 6.5 million in Europe and around 3.5 million in the United States – makes China the leading country for GHG emissions saved through road electrification.

Sources: IEA analysis based on the Global Energy and Climate Model, IFP, GREET, EV Volumes, Dai et al., Degen et al., Frith et al.. The importance of vehicle lifecycle emissions is being increasingly recognised in the policy sphere. The EU battery regulation requires a battery passport that includes the battery carbon emissions and, in 2023, France announced new eligibility rules f or EV subsidies. These set a cap on the carbon intensity of vehicle production to promote vehicles with lower emissions across their full lifecycle, and include the calculation methodology. Elsewhere, the Brazilian government has issued a provisional measure to establish a programme that would set minimum recycling requirements in vehicle manufacturing and reduce taxes for companies with lower pollution and emissions levels. The EU HDV CO 2 standards include a review clause to evaluate the possibility of developing a common methodology for the assessment and reporting of the full lifecycle CO2 emissions of new HDVs. Further efforts are needed to decarbonise battery manufacturing and the processing of critical minerals Battery chemistry plays an important role in defining the lifecycle emissions of EV batteries. In order to decarbonise battery manufacturing, policy ambition and concerted action to define common LCA methodologies and improve transparency will be required across the entire battery supply chain. Initiatives like the battery passport are particularly important towards this aim. 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% China India United Kingdom United States Emissions relative to ICEV ICEV HEV PHEV BEV Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for emissions reductions PAGE | 160 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Of the two main chemistries currently used, high- nickel NMC and LFP, the emissions per kWh of LFP batteries are about one-third lower than NMC batteries at the pack level. In the context of carbon tariffs, or eligibility rules for EV subsidies based on lifecycle emissions, EV and battery producers might therefore be incentivised to rely more on LFP batteries, which today are almost exclusively produced in China, rather than the more emissions-intensive NMC batteries. The main source of emissions across the battery lifecycle depends on the chemistry. Critical minerals processing accounts for 55% of total emissions for NMC, compared to 35% for LFP. Battery manufacturing accounts for almost 50% of LFP total emissions, against 15% for NMC. The production of active material for both cathode (NMC or LFP) and anode (graphite) materials is also important, and currently accounts for about 25% of NMC and 15% of LFP emissions. Strategies to reduce emissions from high- nickel chemistries should focus on critical minerals processing, such as for nickel ores.",

Strategies to reduce emissions from high- nickel chemistries should focus on critical minerals processing, such as for nickel ores. Improving energy and process efficiency for critical minerals processing, active material production and battery manufacturing can also help, as can electrification along different steps in the supply chain, whenever possible. At the same time, as more retired EV batteries become available, replacing increasing shares of material inputs with recycled content will not only reduce emissions but also improve overall battery supply chain sustainability. I n the case of LFP batteries, in particular, decarbonisation strategies should focus on reducing battery manufacturing emissions through higher efficiency and electrification, while reducing emissions associated with lithium ore processing. Using low- carbon electricity can also support the decarbonisation of battery production. Electricity-related emissions today account for about 20% and 25% of NMC and LFP total lifecycle emissions, respectively. Sourcing this electricity from lower-carbon s ources 40 is therefore important, but it is not sufficient for deep battery decarbonisation, which would require higher levels of electrification compared to today’s 20-25% electrification rates over the entire battery cell supply chain. Other important strategies to reduce battery -related emissions are increasing the energy density, which decreases the battery material intensity, and recycling. In the APS, battery lifecycle emissions decrease by about 35% for both NMC and LFP through 2035, thanks to 30% higher ener gy density at the battery pack level, decarbonisation of power grids, and 20% of the cathode active material sourced through recycling. 40 Electricity carbon emission in this analysis ranges between 400 and 420 g/kWh for the different battery supply chain steps.

    "text": "CC BY 4.0. Annex B: Lifecycle analysis assessment “Tank-to-wheel” emissions are emissions from fuel combustion. “Well-to-tank” emissions are associated with fuel production over the vehicle lifetime. In the case of EVs, well -to-tank emissions are those associated with electricity generation, distribution and charging losses; for ICEVs they are the upstream emissions associated with the production, refining and transport of the gasoline. “Grid decarbonisation impact” refers to the effect of electricity emissions intensity improvements over the lifetime of the vehicle. Assumptions behind emission values used in this report Emission values for car production are for a medium -sized passenger light-duty vehicle and based on weighted global averages by production of the materials. The battery electric vehicle (BEV) is considered to have a real -world range of 350 km with a battery capacity of 60 kWh. The plug- in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is considered to have a gasoline engine, a battery capacity of 15 kWh to enable a 60 km electric range, and a utility factor of 40%, meaning 40% of the kilometres are electrically driven. Fuel economy improvements over time vary by scenario and by region. For the world average, a lifetime activity of about 200 000 km over 15 years is assumed. For the regional analysis, l ifetime activity of about 330 000 km, 170 000 km, 120 000 km, and 260 000 km is assumed for the United States, United Kingdom, China, and India, respectively. Calculations of lifecycle emissions account for mileage decay, assuming that highest annual mileage occurs in the first year of operation, with mileage in each subsequent year being equal to around 95% of the previous year. This means that by year 15, the car is driven for around half of the annual mileage of year 1. By taking into account mileage decay, our LCA results place more emphasis on the near term, as opposed to assuming constant mileage over the car’s lifetime. Biofuel blending is not considered. Improvements in the emissions intensity of gasoline production are included, in line with those of IEA modelling in the respective scenario. For car production, world averages related to energy inputs and emissions intensity of mining and material production are assumed. Actual vehicle production emissions would vary based on regional energy mixes associated with each supply chain step. Global EV Outlook 2024 Annexes PAGE | 166 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Battery emissions are calculated using the 2023 chemistry sales -weighted average. NMC811 (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2)) is used as a representative chemistry of the high- nickel class, given its larger market share today and considering that lifecycle emissions for individual battery designs within that class are similar. The battery pack energy densities used refer to the 2023 sales -weighted average and are around 135 Wh/kg for LFP and 165 Wh/kg for NMC811. 2035 emissions assu me 30% increased energy density at the battery pack level, and 20% of the cathode active material sourced through recycling.",

About Copper: What it is? Copper (Cu) is a naturally occurring metallic element (Atomic number: 29) known for its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. 1/2 It is among the oldest metals used by humans and is central to modern industrial, digital and green economies. Characteristics of Copper: Chemical characteristics: Symbol: Cu and Atomic weight: 63.546 amu High resistance to corrosion and oxidation Forms important alloys such as brass (Cu+Zn) and bronze (Cu+Sn) Physical characteristics: Excellent electrical and thermal conductivity (second only to silver) Ductile and malleable, enabling easy wiring and shaping Naturally reddish-brown; one of the few coloured metals Unique properties: 100% recyclable without loss of quality Antimicrobial in nature, useful in healthcare settings Enhances energy efficiency, reducing CO ₂ emissions over product life cycles Applications of Copper: Energy and power sector: Used extensively in power grids, transformers, renewable energy systems, and battery storage. Electric vehicles (EVs): EVs use over twice the copper of conventional vehicles due to motors, batteries and wiring. Digital and AI infrastructure: Data centres, especially hyperscale AI facilities, require massive copper volumes for cooling and power transmission. Construction and manufacturing: Plumbing, roofing, industrial machinery and electronics rely heavily on copper. Defence and healthcare: Used in defence electronics, ammunition and antimicrobial medical surfaces. India and Copper: Current Status India is recognised copper as a critical mineral under its resource strategy. Over 90% dependence on imported copper concentrate Major producers across globe: Chile, Peru, DR Congo, China, USA 2/2",

Flanagan [(703) 648–7726, dflanagan@usgs.gov] COPPER (Data in thousand metric tons of contained copper unless otherwise noted) Domestic Production and Use: In 2022, the recoverable copper content of U.S. mine production was an estimated 1.3 million tons, an increase of 6% from that in 2021, and was valued at an estimated $11 billion, 6% less than $11.7 billion in 2021. Arizona was the leading copper-producing State and accounted for approximately 70% of domestic output; copper was also mined in Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. Copper was recovered or processed at 25 mines (17 of which accounted for more than 99% of mine production), 2 primary smelters, 2 electrolytic refineries, and 14 electrowinning facilities. An additional primary smelter and electrolytic refinery have been closed indefinitely since October 2019, and a new secondary smelter was in the process of starting up as of September. Refined copper and scrap were consumed at about 30 brass mills, 14 rod mills, and 500 foundries and miscellaneous manufacturers.

COPPER U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries, January 2023 Events, Trends, and Issues: In 2022, the largest increase in mined copper output in the United States was at the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, where ore grades and recovery rates were higher than those in 2021 following the transition to mining a new area of the open pit. Copper production also rose significantly at the Morenci a nd Safford Mines in Arizona, reflecting increased mining, milling, and (or) leaching rates. Owing to labor shortages and lower copper ore grades, the most significant decrease in mined copper output was at the Mission Mine in Arizona. The rampups of the Gunnison Mine in Arizona and the Pumpkin Hollow Mine in Nevada continued to be delayed by technical issues. Refined copper production in the United States increased by an estimated 3% in 2022 compared with that in 2021 because of a greater supply of copper concentrates to the Miami smelter in Arizona, which was partially offset by unplanned stoppages and labor shortages at the Garfield smelter in Utah. A new smelter in North Carolina designed to produce copper anodes from scrap was in the process of ramping u p as of September, and at least five other domestic facilities that would recover copper from scrap were expected to begin operating within the next few years. In August, a leading copper wire-rod plant in Amarillo, TX, was indefinitely shut down owing to high production costs, maintenance issues, and labor shortages. The annual average COMEX copper price was projected to be about $4 per pound in 2022, 6% less than that in 2021. Analysts attributed the decreased price primarily to widespread global expectations for reduced economic growth and lower demand for copper in the near future, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation measures in China, and increased strength of the United States dollar relative to other currencies. World Mine and Refinery Production and Reserves: Reserves for Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Peru, Poland, the United States, and Zambia were revised based on company and Government reports.",

At the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, copper production was affected by record-high snowfall in the first quarter and a conveyor belt motor failure that resulted in the concentrator operating at a reduced capacity for several months. At the Robinson Mine in Nevada, low-grade copper ores were processed owing to planned mine sequencing. Production also decreased at multiple mines in Arizona and New Mexico because of unplanned maintenance and lower ore grades and mining rates. The rampups of the Gunnison Mine in Arizona and the Pumpkin Hollow Mine in Nevada continued to be delayed, but ore processing restarted at Pumpkin Hollow in October following a suspension of over a year to address geotechnical challenges. Copper production at U.S. refineries decreased by an estimated 7% in 2023 compared with that in 2022 because of a major rebuild of the smelter and electrolytic refinery near Salt Lake City, UT, from May to September. A new refinery in Kentucky designed to produce copper cathodes from scrap was anticipated to begin operating by yearend 2023, and at least three other domestic facilities that would recover copper from scrap in the form of anodes or cathodes were expected to start within the next several years. The annual average COMEX copper price was projected to be about $3.90 per pound in 2023, 3% less than that in 2022. Analysts attributed the decreased price primarily to strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other global currencies and concerns regarding economic growth in China and inflation. World Mine and Refinery Production and Reserves: Reserves for Australia, China, Congo (Kinshasa), Peru, Poland, Russia, the United States, Zambia, and “Other countries” were revised based on company and Government reports.",

Flanagan [(703) 648–7726, dflanagan@usgs.gov] COPPER (Data in thousand metric tons, copper content, unless otherwise specified) Domestic Production and Use: In 2024, the recoverable copper content of U.S. mine production was an estimated 1.1 million tons, a decrease of 3% from that in 2023, and was valued at an estimated $10 billion, slightly greater than $9.83 billion in 2023. Arizona was the leading copper-producing State and accounted for approximately 70% of domestic output; copper was also mined in Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. Copper was recovered or processed at 25 mines (17 of which accounted for more than 99% of mine production), 2 primary smelters, 1 secondary smelter, 2 primary electrolytic refineries, 14 electrowon refineries, and 3 secondary fire refineries. A new secondary smelter and secondary refinery were expected to start up by yearend. Refined copper and scrap were consumed at about 30 brass mills, 14 rod mills, and several hundred foundries and miscellaneous manufacturers. According to the Copper Development Association, copper and copper alloy products were used in building construction, 42%; electrical and electronic products, 23%; transportation equipment, 18%; consumer and general products, 10%; and industrial machinery and equipment, 7%.

At the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, changes to the mine plan required to mitigate geotechnical risks resulted in lower ore grades and copper recoveries. Production at the Eagle Mine in Michigan was affected by decreased copper ore grades and reduced mill throughput rates owing to a fall of ground along an ore access ramp. Output also decreased at multiple mines in Arizona and New Mexico because of lower ore grades and mining rates. These decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in mined copper production at the Robinson Mine in Nevada owing to planned mine sequencing that yielded higher ore grades and copper recovery rates. At U.S. refineries, copper production increased slightly in 2024 compared with that in 2023. The Kennecott smelter and electrolytic refinery near Salt Lake City, UT, returned to normal operations in the first quarter of 2024 following major rebuilds in 2023. A new secondary copper refinery in Kentucky and a new secondary copper smelter in Georgia were expected to begin operating by yearend 2024. The COMEX copper price reached a record high in May 2024 and was projected to average $4.20 per pound in full year 2024, an increase of 9% from the annual average price in 2023. Analysts attributed the higher price to multiple factors, such as expectations for reduced global copper supply in the near future, optimistic sentiment regarding world copper demand, strong manufacturing production in China, and decreasing inflation in the United States. World Mine and Refinery Production and Reserves: Reserves for Canada, Indonesia, Peru, and the United States were revised based on company, Government, and (or) industry association reports.",
