VERDICT SUMMARY
The analysis suggests a moderately favorable outlook for copper investment, driven by strong EV demand fundamentals, though tempered by near-term volatility concerns.

KEY FINDINGS
• EV adoption growing 23% annually, creating structural demand
• Supply deficit projected at 400,000 tonnes by 2026
• Price volatility remains elevated (23% range in Q4 2024)
• China concentration risk (54% of demand) warrants monitoring
